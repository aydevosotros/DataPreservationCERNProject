      Subroutine subprograms RSRTNT and DSRTNT
      calculate, based on indefinite integration, the definite
      integral
    




      for k=-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 and n=1,3, provided
      that  for u
      < x < v and the limits
      u,v are such that the integral converges.
      In particular, the Cauchy principal value is taken if
      k=-1 and uv < 0.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DSRTNT is not provided.

SUBROUTINE subprograms

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tSRTNT(K,N,A,B,C,U,V,RES,LRL)



        K
      

        (INTEGER) Power k of x.
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) Power n of  .
      

        A,B,C
      

        (type according to t) Coefficients
        a,b,c.
      

        U,V
      

        (type according to t) Limits of integration
        u,v.
      

        RES
      

        (type according to t) Contains, on exit, the value
        I provided  ,
        the value zero otherwise.
      

        LRL
      

        (LOGICAL) Contains, on exit, the value
        .TRUE. if the integral exists in the sense
        described above, the value .FALSE. otherwise.
      


Restrictions:


      1.  2.  ;  or
       .
    

Error handling:


      Error B300.1: Restriction 1 is not satisfied. Error
      B300.2: Restriction 2 is not satisfied.
      In both cases, RES is set equal to zero and
      LRL is set equal to .FALSE., and a message
      is written on Unit 6, unless subroutine
      MTLSET (N002) has been called.
