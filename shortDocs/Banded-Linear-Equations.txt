      Subroutine subprograms RBEQN and DBEQN
      solve a system of N simultaneous linear equations
      with K right-hand sides, the coefficient matrix
      being a band matrix with bandwidth 2M+1:
    




      Only those coefficients  for
      which  need be supplied
      on entry (see Usage).

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tBEQN(N,M,ABAND,IDIM,IFAIL,K,B)



        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number of equations.
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) Band parameter M.
      

        ABAND
      

        (type according to t) Two-dimensional array whose
        first dimension has the value IDIM.
      

        IDIM
      

        (INTEGER) First dimension of array ABAND
        (and of array B if  ).
      

        IFAIL
      

        (INTEGER) On exit, IFAIL will be set to
        -1 if the coefficient matrix is singular, and to
        0 otherwise.
      

        K
      

        (INTEGER) Number of right-hand sides in array
        B.
      

        B
      

        (type according to t) In general, a
        two-dimensional array whose first dimension has the value
        IDIM. B may be one-dimensional if
         .
      


      On entry, ABAND must contain the packed form of the
      coefficient matrix as described below, and array B
      must contain the matrix of right-hand sides  . Then, provided the coefficient matrix is
      non-singular, IFAIL will be set to 0 and the
      solution  will replace
       in B.
      The contents of ABAND are destroyed. If the
      coefficient matrix is singular, IFAIL will be set to
      -1. In this case the contents of ABAND and
      B are unpredictable.
    

      The storage convention for ABAND is that it must
      contain, on entry, those coefficients  for which  ,
      stored "left-justified" as an array of N rows and at
      most  columns. For
      example, if  and  , the coefficient matrix
    




      where X denotes elements whose value need not to be
      set.
    

      If ALPHA(I,J) is a function subprogram or statement
      function which computes  ,
      the following Fortran statements will set ABAND
      correctly:
    

      DO 2 I =1,N
      L = 1
      DO 1 J = MAX(I-M,1),MIN(I+M,N)
      ABAND(I,L) = ALPHA(I,J)
      L = L+1
    1 CONTINUE
    2 CONTINUE


Method:


      Gaussian elimination with row interchanges. The storage
      organization is as described in the reference.
    

Error handling:


      If the integer arguments do not satisfy the conditions
       , a message is
      printed and program execution is terminated by calling
      ABEND (Z035).
