      Let a function f(x) be given by its values
      at certain discrete points 
      . Let the function values  be
      accompanied by an estimated standard deviation  (square root of the variance). Subroutine
      subprogram TRAPER then approximates the integral
    




      by a linear combination of the 
      using the trapezoidal rule. It calculates the standard
      deviation  of I by
    




      The function values f(A) and
      f(B) are calculated by linear
      interpolation.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: TRAPER


Usage:


    CALL TRAPER(X,Y,E,N,A,B,RE,SD)



        X,Y,E
      

        (REAL) Arrays of length  containing  ,
        respectively.
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number of function values
      

        A,B
      

        (REAL) Limits of integration.
      

        RE
      

        (REAL) On exit, RE contains an
        approximate value of the integral I.
      

        SD
      

        (REAL) On exit, SD contains an
        approximate value of the standard deviation  .
      


      If no  are given, the
      array E should be filled with zeros.
    

Restrictions:


      Although there are no restrictions on A and
      B (B may be less than A), care
      must be taken if one or both of them is either smaller than
      X(1) or bigger than X(N). In these cases
       or  are extrapolated linearly from
      Y(1) and Y(2) or Y(N-1) and
      Y(N) respectively, which may lead to unreasonable
      results. If  or  , RE and SD will be set
      to zero. It is assumed that all the  are distinct. No test is made for this.
    

Notes:


      This program should only be used for the problem described
      above. For general-purpose numerical integration to a
      preassigned accuracy use GAUSS (D103).
