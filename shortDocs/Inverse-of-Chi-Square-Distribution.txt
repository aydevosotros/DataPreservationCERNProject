      Function subprogram CHISIN calculates  for a given probability  and a given degree of freedom N, where
    




      and  and  .
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Name: CHISIN
      Files Referenced: Unit 6
      External References: GAUSIN,
      MTLMTR, ABEND


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


CHISIN(P,N) has the value  ,
      


      where CHISIN and P are of type
      REAL, and N is of type INTEGER.
    

Method:


      The method is described in Ref. 1. Note that there the
      complementary integral is taken.
    

Accuracy:


      Approximately three to six digits are correct. The case
      N = 3 is the least accurate.
    

Error handling:


      Error G101.1:  or
       .
      Error G101.2: 
      .
      In both cases, the function value is set equal to zero, and a
      message is written on Unit 6, unless subroutine
      MTLSET (N002) has been called.
    

      This subprogram is based on an Algol60 procedure published in
      Ref. 1.
