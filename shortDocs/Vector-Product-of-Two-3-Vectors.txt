      Subroutine subprogram CROSS computes the vector (or
      cross) product
    




      of two 3-vectors  .
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: CROSS
COMMON Block Names and Lengths: /SLATE/ 40


Usage:


    CALL CROSS(A,B,C)



        A,B
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional arrays of length
        3, containing the components  ,
 , respectively.
      

        C
      

        (REAL) On exit, C contains the components
         of  , i.e.
      







 .
      


C may overlap either A or B.
