      Function subprogram DIVDIF interpolates in a table
      of arguments  and function
      values  , using an
      interpolating polynomial of specified degree which passes
      through tabular points which are symmetrically-positioned
      around the interpolation argument. The table arguments
       need not be
      equidistant.

Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


DIVDIF(F,A,N,X,M)



      has an approximate value of  .
    


        F
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array. F(j) must
        be equal to the value at A(j) of the function to
        be interpolated,  .
      

        A
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array. A(j) must
        be equal to the table argument  .
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number of values in arrays F
        and A.
      

        X
      

        (REAL) Argument at which the interpolating
        polynomial is to be evaluated.
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) Requested degree of the interpolating
        polynomial. If M exceeds  the interpolation is carried out using a
        polynomial of degree 
        instead of M. The original value of M is
        unchanged on exit.
      


Method:


      Newton's divided difference formula is used. Except when
      X lies near one end of the table (in which case
      unsymmetrically-situated interpolation points are used), the
      interpolation procedure is as follows:
M odd:
      An interpolating polynomial passing through  successive points  symmetrically placed with respect to
      X is used.
M even:
      The mean of two interpolating polynomials is used, each
      passing through  successive
      points  , one polynomial
      having an extra point to the left of X, the other
      having an extra point to the right of X.
      If X lies too close to either end of the table for
      symmetrically-positioned tabular values to be used, the
       values at the
      end of the table are used. If X lies outside the
      range of the table, the interpolation becomes an
      extrapolation, with corresponding loss of accuracy.
    

Restrictions:


      The argument values 
      must be in either strictly increasing order or strictly
      decreasing order. No error message is printed if this is not
      true.
    

Error handling:


      Error E105.1:  or
       .
      DIVDIF is set equal to zero and a message is printed
      unless subroutine KERSET (N001) has been called.
