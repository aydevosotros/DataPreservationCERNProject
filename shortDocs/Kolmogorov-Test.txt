      Subroutine subprogram TKOLMO tests whether two
      one-dimensional sets of points are compatible with coming
      from the same parent distribution, using the Kolmogorov test.
      That is, it is used to compare two experimental distributions
      of unbinned data.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Name: TKOLMO
      External routine referenced: PROBKL (G102)
    

Usage:


    CALL TKOLMO(A,NA,B,NB,PROB)



        A,B
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional arrays of length
        NA, NB, respectively. The elements of
        A and B must be given in ascending order.
        (This can be accomplished, for example, by using
        FLPSOR (M103)).
      

        NA,NB
      

        (INTEGER) The number of points in A and
        B, respectively.
      

        PROB
      

        (REAL) A calculated confidence level which gives a
        statistical test for compatibility of A and
        B.
      


      Values of PROB close to zero are taken as indicating
      a small probability of compatibility. For two point sets
      drawn randomly from the same parent distribution, the value
      of PROB should be uniformly distributed between zero
      and one.
    

Method:


      The Kolmogorov test is used. The test statistic is the
      maximum deviation between the two integrated distribution
      functions, multiplied by the normalizing factor  , where M and N are the
      numbers of points in the two samples.
    

Accuracy:


      Approximately seven digits are correct.
    

Notes:


      Probabilities smaller than  are
      set to zero. However, the method has a statistical meaning
      only for "large" M and N (>10).
