BINSIZ determines reasonable lower and upper limits
      and bin width for a histogram, given the lower and upper
      limits of the data and the desired maximum number of bins.
      The output bin width is always an integral power of
       or 5, and the
      output lower and upper limits are the nearest multiples of
      the bin width containing the specified range. Another option
      allows the bin width to be imposed and determines only the
      new limits.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: BINSIZ


Usage:


    CALL BINSIZ(AL,AH,NA,BL,BH,NB,BWID)



        AL
      

        (REAL) Lower limit of data to be histogrammed.
      

        AH
      

        (REAL) Upper limit of data to be histogrammed.
      

        NA
      

        (INTEGER) Maximum number of bins desired.
      

        BL
      

        (REAL) Lower limit determined by BINSIZ
 .
      

        BH
      

        (REAL) Upper limit determined by BINSIZ
 .
      

        NB
      

        (INTEGER) Number of bins determined by
        BINSIZ  .
      

        BWID
      

        (REAL) Bin width  .
      


      If  or  , BINSIZ always makes exactly one bin.
    

      If  , BINSIZ
      takes BWID as input and determines only
      BL, BH, and NB. This is especially
      useful when it is desired to have the same bin width for
      several histograms (or for the two axes of a scatter-plot).
    

      If  , BINSIZ
      takes AL to be the upper limit and AH to be
      the lower limit, so that in fact AL and AH
      may appear in any order. They are not changed by
      BINSIZ. If  ,
      BINSIZ takes the lower limit as AL, and the
      upper limit is set to 
      .
