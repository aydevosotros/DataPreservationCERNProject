      The MINUIT package performs minimization and
      analysis of the shape of a multi-parameter function. It is
      intended to be used on Chisquare or likelihood functions for
      fitting data and finding parameter errors and correlations.
      The more important options offered are:
    





        Variable metric (Fletcher) minimization
      




        Monte Carlo minimization
      




        Simplex (Nelder and Mead) minimization
      




        Parabolic error analysis (error matrix)
      




        MINOS (non-linear) error analysis
      




        Contour plotting
      




        Fixing and restoring parameters
      




        Global minimization

Usage:


MINUIT can be used either
    


        as a ``master'' batch program which reads and executes
        commands appearing in the input data stream;
      


      or
    


        as a ``master'' interactive program which reads and
        executes commands given from the terminal;
      


      or
    


        as a Fortran callable ``slave'' package, called from the
        user program or from an intermediate package such as
        PAW or HBOOK;
      


      or
    


        any combination of the above.
      


      See Long Write-up for details.
