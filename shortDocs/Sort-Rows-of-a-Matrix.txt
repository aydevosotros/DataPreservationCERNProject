SORTRQ rearranges the row order of a matrix in such
      a way that the elements of a selected column are either in
      increasing or decreasing order, as desired. Row orders are
      not necessarily preserved in case these elements are equal.
      Otherwise, SORTRQ does the same job as
      SORTR (M107), but SORTRQ is sometimes
      faster.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: SORTIQ, SORTRQ, SORTDQ
      External References: USWOP
      (not on all machines)
    

Usage:


      For  (type
      INTEGER),  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL SORTtQ(MX,NC,NR,NCS)


      performs an ordering operation on the matrix MX of
      type t, dimensioned (NC,NR), using the
      NCS-th elements of each row as ordering criterion.
    

      The matrix MX is stored by rows, the first element
      of a row following immediatly after the last element of the
      preceding row.
    

      Obviously,  is a condition. If
      this is not met, or if  ,
      SORTtQ will do nothing.
    

      If  , SORTRQ
      reorders the rows of MX in such a way that the
      NCS-th element of each row is  the NCS-th element of the preceding
      row. If  , the rows of
      MX are reordered in the strict reverse order to that
      for  .
    

      Based on an Algol procedure described in Ref. 1.
