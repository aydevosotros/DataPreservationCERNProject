      Function subprogram packages RGMLT and
      DGMLT compute an approximate value of an
      n-dimensional integral of the form


      where  .
    

      Each subprogram integrates over only one variable. The
      integral  is computed by
      means of a set of n nested calls to these
      subprograms.
    

      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision version DGMLT is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RGMLT is available.

Usage:


Let k be one of the integers  . Then, in any arithmetic expression,
        

RGMLTk(FSUBk,Ak,Bk,NIk,NGk,X) or
          

DGMLTk(FSUBk,Ak,Bk,NIk,NGk,X)

has the approximate value of the integral with respect
        to  of the function
        specified below.
RGMLTk is of type REAL, DGMLTk
        is of type DOUBLE PRECISION, and the arguments
        Ak, Bk, and X have the same type
        as the function name. NIk and NGk are of
        type INTEGER.
        

            FSUBk
          

            Name of a user-supplied SUBROUTINE subprogram,
            declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
          

            Ak,Bk
          

            End points of the integration interval for variable
             .
          

            NIk
          

            Number of equal subintervals into which the interval
            (Ak,Bk) is divided.
          

            NGk
          

            Number of Gaussian quadrature points to be used in each
            of the NIk subintervals. (If NGk has
            any value other than 6 or 8, the
            value 6 is assumed).
          

            X
          

            0ne-dimensional array of dimension  .
          


The subroutine FSUBk should be of the form
        

SUBROUTINE FSUBk (M,Uk,Fk,X)

where Uk, Fk and X are of
        type REAL for RGMLTk and of type
        DOUBLE PRECISION for DGMLTk, and where
        M is of type INTEGER.
        

            M
          

            An integer  ,
            whose value is set by RGMLTk (DGMLTk).
          

            Uk
          

            One-dimensional array with declared dimension
            (*), whose contents is set by RGMLTk
            (DGMLTk).
          

            Fk
          

            One-dimensional array with declared dimension
            (*), whose contents must be set by
            FSUBk as described below.
          

            X
          

            One-dimensional array which must be the same as the
            array X appearing as an actual argument in all
            calls to RGMLT1, RGMLT2, 
            (DGMLT1, DGMLT2,  ).
          




      The subprogram RGMLTk (DGMLTk) which calls
      subroutine FSUBk sets the value of M and
      places in array Uk a set of M values of the
      variable  . Then, if
       denotes the
      function which is to be integrated with respect to
       , it is the job
      of subroutine FSUBk to set X(k) to the
      appropriate value of  ,
      to compute  for each of
      these values of  (taking the
      remaining variables 
      from X(k+1), 
      ,X(n) respectively) and place the results in array
      Fk. (See Examples).
    

Method:


      Integration with respect to each variable is performed by
      applying the 6- or 8-point Gaussian quadrature formula to
      each of the equal sub-intervals.
    

Notes:


The time needed to compute an n-dimensional
      integral by means of these subprograms is approximately
        



          This should be kept in mind when choosing the values of
          NIk.
        

The accuracy of a particular calculation can be estimated
      by repeating the integration with different values of
      NGk (e.g., 8 instead of 6) or by changing
      NIk, the latter usually being less economical.
      


Error handling:


      Error D110.1:  . A
      message is written on Unit 6, unless subroutine
      MTLSET (N002) has been called. Execution is halted
      on a STOP instruction.
    

Examples:


      To calculate (in type REAL) the integral
    




      using 6-point Gaussian quadrature over each of  subdivisions of the corresponding
      interval. In the main program, write for instance
    

    ...
    EXTERNAL FSUB2
    DIMENSION X(2)
    Q2=RGMLT2(FSUB2,0.,1.,3,6,X)
    ...


      For the SUBROUTINE subprograms FSUB2,
      FSUB1 write for instance
    

    SUBROUTINE FSUB2(M,U2,F2,X)
    EXTERNAL FSUB1
    DIMENSION U2(*),F2(*),X(2)
    DO 1 L = 1,M
    X(2)=U2(L)
    R=SQRT(X(2))
  1 F2(L)=R*EXP(X(2))*RGMLT1(FSUB1,0.,R,4,6,X)
    RETURN
    END
 
    SUBROUTINE FSUB1(M,U1,F1,X)
    DIMENSION U1(*),F1(*),X(2)
    DO 1 L = 1,M
    X(1)=U1(L)
  1 F1(L)=X(1)*SQRT(X(1)**2+X(2))
    RETURN
    END
