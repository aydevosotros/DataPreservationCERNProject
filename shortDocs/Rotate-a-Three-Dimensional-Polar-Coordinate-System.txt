POLROT calculates the values of  and  of the
      coordinate system  , obtained by
      rotation of the 3-dimensional polar coordinate system
       about any axis
       .
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: POLROT


Usage:


    CALL POLROT(THETA,PHI,THPRIM,PHPRIM,THAX,PHAX,ROTANG)



        THETA
      

        (REAL) Angle  in
        the old system  .
      

        PHI
      

        (REAL) Angle  in
        the old system  .
      

        THPRIM
      

        (REAL) Angle  in
        the new system  .
      

        PHPRIM
      

        (REAL) Angle  in
        the new system  .
      

        THAX,PHAX
      

        (REAL) Angles defining the axis of rotation in the
        old system  .
      

        ROTANG
      

        (REAL) Angle in the old system through which the
        system is rotated.
      


      The subroutine calculates from THETA and
      PHI the new values THPRIM and
      PHPRIM in a coordinate system obtained by rotating
      the old system through an angle ROTANG about an axis
      defined by THAX and PHAX in the old system.
    

Method:


THETA and PHI are converted to a unit
      vector in Cartesian coordinates; THAX, PHAX
      and ROTANG are converted to a tensor, which is used
      to obtain a vector in the new system of axes giving
      THPRIM and PHPRIM.
    

Notes:


      If THPRIM is very small, PHPRIM is badly
      defined.
