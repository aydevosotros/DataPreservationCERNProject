      Subroutine subprograms RDEQMR and DDEQMR
      advance the solution of the system of  simultaneous first-order differential equations
    




      from a specified value  to a
      specified value  of the
      independent variable x. The integration step-length
      is automatically adjusted to keep the estimated error per
      step less than a specified value.
    

      On computers other than CDC and Cray, only the
      double-precision version DDEQBS is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RDEQBS is available.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tDEQMR(N,X1,X2,Y,H0,EPS,SUB,W)



        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number n of equations.
      

        X1
      

        (type according to t) Initial value  of the
        independent variable x.
      

        X2
      

        (type according to t) Final value  of the independent variable x.
      

        Y
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  N. On
        entry,  , must contain
         . On exit,
         , contains
        approximate values  .
      

        H0
      

        (type according to t) On entry, H0 must
        contain the proposed initial step-length  . On exit, H0 contains the last
        computed step-length (See also Method and
        Notes).
      

        EPS
      

        (type according to t) The requested absolute
        accuracy  .
        (EPS should not be smaller than approximately
         times the
        machine precision).
      

        SUB
      

        Name of a user-supplied SUBROUTINE subprogram,
        declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
      

        W
      

        (type according to t) Array containing at least
        6*N elements required as working-space.
      


      The user-supplied subroutine SUB should be of the
      form
    

    SUBROUTINE SUB(X,Y,F)


      where the variable X and the one-dimensional arrays
      Y(*) and F(*) are of type t. This
      subroutine must set
    




Method:


      The method is a modification by Merson of the Runge-Kutta
      method. The initial value of the step-length h is
      taken to be the first of the numbers  for which the estimated relative error at the
      end of the step is less than  .
      At each susequent step, an estimate of the integration error
      for that step (proportional to  ) is computed. If the corresponding relative
      error exceeds  , the current
      step-length is halfed; if it is less than  the step-length is doubled. This process is
      continued until  is reached.
      (For details, see Ref. 1).
    

Error handling:


      Error D202.1: If the requestec accuracy cannot
      obtained, a message is written on Unit 6, unless
      subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been called.
      For  , or  or  ,
      control is returned to the calling program without any change
      in Y.
    

Notes:


      For well-conditioned systems of equations any reasonable
      value of the initial step length  may be chosen. For ill-conditioned systems,
      the initial value of  may
      be important, and tests with different values are advised. An
      inappropriate choice may lead to wrong results in such cases.
