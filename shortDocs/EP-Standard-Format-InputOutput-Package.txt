      The EP format off-line package is intended to be used for all
      data (at least on tape) in an experiment, in such a way that
      from the raw data tape to the DST, the tape (or file) format
      is identical. This makes the transport of data between
      computers easier, and simplifies the task of passing the
      files or tapes at different stages of the production chain
      through any other part of the production chain. EPIO
      is designed to make almost all features of the very flexible
      EP format available to the user.
