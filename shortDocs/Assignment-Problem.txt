      Subroutine subprogram ASSNDX solves the so-called
      Assignment problem: Given an  matrix A of real numbers
      a(i,j), find either
    

a set  , where
         indicates
         zeros, and where
        for non-zero elements  for
         , which
        minimizes
        



          assuming that a(i,0)=0, or
        

a set  , where
       indicates
       zeros, and where
      for non-zero elements  for
       , which
      minimizes
        



          assuming that a(0,j)=0.
        



Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: ASSNDX
      Files Referenced: Unit 6


Usage:


    CALL ASSNDX(MODE,A,N,M,IDA,K,SMIN,IW,IDW)



        MODE
      

        (INTEGER) Must be set either 1 (for case
        (1)), or 2 (for case (2)).
      

        A
      

        (REAL) Two-dimensional array of dimension (
         ). Must
        contain, on entry, the matrix A. Destroyed during
        execution.
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number n of rows of A.
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) Number m of columns of
        A.
      

        IDA
      

        (INTEGER) Declared first dimension of A
        in the calling program (  .
      

        K
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional array of length
         . Contains, on
        exit, the assigned set of integers  or  ,
        respectively.
      

        SMIN
      

        (REAL) The calculated minimum value of S.
      

        IW
      

        (INTEGER) Two-dimensional array of dimension (
         ). Used as
        working space.
      

        IDW
      

        (INTEGER) Declared first dimension of IW
        in the calling program (  ).
      


Method:


      The subprogram is based on the Algol procedure given in Ref.
      3.
    

Error handling:


      Error H301.1:  or
       .
      A message is written on Unit 6, unless subroutine
      MTLSET (N002) has been called.
    

Examples:


      The following example illustrates a possible use of the
      subprogram. A workshop has to carry out N jobs, each
      of which can be performed on any of M
      (>N) available machines. The cost of performing
      job I on machine J is
      A(I,J). It is required to assign
      jobs to machines in such a way as to minimize the total cost.
      The solution is obtained by calling the subprogram with
       and then
      assigning job I to machine  .
