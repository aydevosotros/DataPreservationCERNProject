      The LANDAU function subprogram package contains six
      independent subprograms for the calculation of the following
      functions related to the Landau distribution:
    




      The function  can be used to
      generate Landau random numbers (see Usage).
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: DENLAN,
      DISLAN, DIFLAN, XM1LAN, XM2LAN, RANLAN
      Obsolete User Entry Names: DSTLAN  DISLAN


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    








DENLAN(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          



DISLAN(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          



DIFLAN(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          



XM1LAN(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          



XM2LAN(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          



RANLAN(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          




      where DENLAN, DISLAN, DIFLAN,
      XM1LAN, XM2LAN, RANLAN and
      X are of type REAL.
    

      To generate a set of Landau random numbers, RANLAN
      should be referenced repeatedly, using as argument a random
      number from a uniform distribution over the interval (0,1).
    

Method:


      Approximation by rational functions. For reason of speed,
      RANLAN proceeds mainly by table look-up and
      quadratic interpolation.
    

Accuracy:


      At least six significant digits (five for RANLAN)
      are correct.
    

Restrictions:


Underflow may occur for DENLAN, DISLAN
      and DIFLAN if X is negative and
      (moderately) large.
      
No test is made whether X for RANLAN
      lies outside the interval (0,1), and hence no error message
      is printed.
      


Notes:


      This program package is a version of the CPC Program
      Library package LANDAU (Ref. 1).
