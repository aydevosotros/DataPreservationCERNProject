      The COMIS package is part of PAW (Q121)
      (Physics Analysis Workstation), but can be used
      independently. It is a Fortran interpreter with which the
      user can interactively define, edit and execute any Fortran
      routines without recompiling and relinking. A small user
      interface system is part of COMIS and an interface
      with the local editor is also provided.
