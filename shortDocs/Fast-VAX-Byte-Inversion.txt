      These routines do VAX byte inversions 1-2-3-4 to
      4-3-2-1 in each word of an array, either in-place or
      copied.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: VXINVB, VXINVC


Usage:


    CALL VXINVB(IXV,N)


      inverts four bytes in each of the N words at array
      IXV, in-place.
    

    CALL VXINVC(IV,IXV,N)


      copies the N words at array IV to array
      IXV, with the bytes inverted in each word.
    

      On DEC machines bytes read from a disk file are loaded in
      memory in reverse order. One of the above routines, applied
      to the result of a binary read from a disk file, causes the
      bytes to be stored in each 32 bits word in the same order
      than in the disk file. This is useful when reading a binary
      file transferred through a network from a foreign system, in
      order to preserve the order of the bytes in each 32 bits
      word. Please note that several network utilities include the
      possibility to perform a bytes inversion in the network
      protocol. Note also that when reading or writing from a
      magnetic tape, the bytes may be swapped in pairs and not in
      groups of 4.
