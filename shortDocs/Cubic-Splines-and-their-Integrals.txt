      Subroutines RCSPLN and DCSPLN compute a
      (vector-valued) cubic spline function F(x)
      which interpolates between a given set of points. Entries
      RCSPNT and DCSPNT compute the first and
      second integral over F(x).
    

      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision versions DCSPLN and DCSPNT
      are available. On CDC and Cray computers, only the
      single-precision versions RCSPLN and RCSPNT
      are available.
    

      Given an interval [a,b], a subdivision of
      this interval into  subintervals
    




      and n+1 function values  on the n+1 abscissae (called `knots')
       (  ), RCSPLN and DCSPLN compute
      a function F(x) of class  , defined on [a,b], which
      assumes the given value  at
      the knot  (i.e.  ), and which, when restricted to the
      ith sub-interval  is
      identical with a set of m polynomials  , each of degree at most 3. Any function
      F(x) which satisfies the above two
      conditions is called a `cubic spline' through the n
      + 1 points  . To define the
      spline function F(x) uniquely the
      subroutines impose an additional boundary condition,
      specified by their MODE parameter:
    


MODE = 0: 
        (the so-called natural spline).
      

MODE = 1: 
        and  .
