BUNCH converts a source array containing
      NBYTES bytes of NBITS bits per byte (where
      each byte is stored right-adjusted in a full word), into a
      target array in which the bytes follow each other
      contiguously without intermediate padding. The last word of
      the target array, if incomplete, is however padded with
      binary zero. BUNCH is the inverse of BLOW
      (M426).
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: BUNCH
      External References: PKCHAR


Usage:


    CALL BUNCH(SOURCE,TARGET,NBYTES,NBITS)



        SOURCE
      

        Source array containing NBYTES bytes, each
        right-adjusted in a full word.
      

        TARGET
      

        Target array, which must be at least  (rounded up to an integral value) words
        long, where  on CDC and
         on IBM.
      

        NBYTES
      

        Number of bytes in the source array  .
      

        NBITS
      

        Number of bits per byte  .
      


Restrictions:


      The arrays SOURCE and TARGET must not
      overlap in any way.
    

Error handling:


BUNCH ignores calls with erroneous parameter values.
    

Examples:


      IBM:
    

    CALL BUNCH(SOURCE,TARGET,200,16)


      The array SOURCE contains 200 words, each containing
      an 16-bit byte, right-adjusted. After returning from
      BUNCH, the array TARGET will contain 100
      32-bit words, in which the 200 16-bit bytes are stored
      contiguously.
