      Subroutine subprograms RLHOIN and DLHOIN
      find the basis  , of the
      convex polyhedral cone defining the solution of a system of
      homogeneous linear inequalities  .  is a given
       matrix,
       , and rank
       .  is a column
      vector. Any solution x of  can be expressed as
    




      where all  . The number
      J of vectors 
      depends on the matrix A in an unknown way,
      except when M=N, where
      J=N.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DLHOIN is not available.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tLHOIN(A,MA,M,N,MAXV,V,NV,JVEC,EPS,IOUT,W,IW)



        A
      

        (type according to t) Two-dimensional array,
        dimensioned  , whose rows
        contain the coefficients of the inequalities, arranged in
        such a way that the upper left  corner has a non-vanishing determinant.
        Usually it is advisable to normalise the rows of A
        to unity before calling this subprogram.
      

        MA
      

        (INTEGER) First dimension parameter of A.
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) Number M of inequalities.
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number N of variables.
      

        MAXV
      

        (INTEGER) Maximum number of basis vectors which
        may occur at any intermediate step, to be chosen
        sufficiently large and in any case  .
      

        V
      

        (type according to t) Two-dimensional array,
        dimensioned  , whose
        columns contain, on return, the basis vectors  of the
        solution cone.
      

        NV
      

        (INTEGER) First dimension parameter of  .
      

        JVEC
      

        (INTEGER) Number J of basis vectors of
        the final cone.
      

        EPS
      

        (type according to t) A small parameter which
        discriminates small quantities against zero, chosen to take
        into account the accuracy of the machine used.
      

        IOUT
      

        (INTEGER)
 Gives no
        intermediate printout,
 Gives, for
        each iteration, the basis vectors of the respective cone,
        the matrix of scalar products and the index of the
        inequality taken into account in the next step.
      

        W
      

        (type according to t) Two-dimensional array,
        dimensioned  , used as
        working space.
      

        IW
      

        (INTEGER) Two-dimensional array, dimensioned
         whose columns
        serve as book-keepers for certain properties of the system
        during the iteration procedure.
      


Method:


      The Motzkin-Burger procedure is used to obtain the solution
      iteratively. Ref. 1 should be consulted before using this
      subprogram.
    

Restrictions:


      The routine may fail if the matrix A is
      "ill-conditioned" in a certain sense.
    

Notes:


      A given system of linear homogenous inequalities may have no
      solution.
    

Error handling:


      Error F500.1:  too
      small.
      Error F500.2: Upper left  corner of A is singular.
      Error F500.3: Inequality k is
      inconsistent.
      In all cases, a message is written on Unit 6, unless
      subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been called.
