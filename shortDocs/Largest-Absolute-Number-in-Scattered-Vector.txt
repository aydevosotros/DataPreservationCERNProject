AMAXMU looks for the largest absolute value in a
      scattered vector of real numbers.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Names: AMAXMU


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


AMAXMU(A,IDO,IW,NA)



      is set to the largest absolute value of numbers in any of the
      subsets of A as specified by IDO,
      IW and NA.
    


        A
      

(REAL) One-dimensional array, containing a number
        of subsets of real numbers.
      

        IDO
      

(INTEGER) Number of subsets to be examined.
      

        IW
      

(INTEGER) Number of words in each subset.
      

        NA
      

(INTEGER) Specifies the distance between the first
        elements of consecutive subsets.
      


Notes:


      To find the largest element in a continuous vector,
      VMAXA (F121) is faster than AMAXMU.
    

Examples:


    X=AMAXMU(A,4,1,2)


      sets X equal to the largest absolute value of
      A(1), A(3), A(5) and
      A(7).
