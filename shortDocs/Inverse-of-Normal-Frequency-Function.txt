      Function subprograms GAUSIN and DGAUSN
      calculate the inverse X(P) of the normal
      frequency function (Gaussian distribution)
    




      for real arguments P, where 0 < P <
      1.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Name: GAUSIN, DGAUSN
      Files Referenced: Unit 6
      External References: MTLMTR,
      ABEND


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


GAUSIN(P) has the value  ,
      


      where GAUSIN and P are of type
      REAL.
    

Method:


      The method is described in Ref. 1.
    

Accuracy:


Accuracy:


GAUSIN (except on CDC and Cray computers) has an
      accuracy of about six digits. For most values of the argument
      P, DGAUSN (and GAUSIN on CDC and
      Cray computers) has an accuracy of approximately one
      significant digit less than the machine precision.
    

Error handling:


      Error G105.1:  or
       .
      The function value is set equal to zero, and a message is
      written on Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET
      (N002) has been called.
    

      This subprogram is based on an Algol60 procedure published in
      Ref. 1.
