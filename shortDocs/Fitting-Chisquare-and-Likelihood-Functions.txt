FUMILI minimizes the objective functions  and ML defined by:
    




      and
    




      with respect to the M parameters A where,
      for each j,  is a
      data-point with user estimated error,  , the  are
      L co-ordinates of that point and Y is a
      theoretical function predicting  for a given set of  and A.
    

      The method makes use of a particular property concerning the
      dependence of the objective function (  or ML) on the theoretical function
      (Y) for faster convergence.
