EPDE1 solves an elliptic partial differential
      equation of general form (Poisson's equation being a special
      case) over a two-dimensional region using a finite difference
      method. The region may be of any shape and on its boundary
      either the dependent variable or a relation involving its
      derivative may be specified.
