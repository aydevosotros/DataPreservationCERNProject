GETBYT extracts and right-adjusts a group of bits of
      any length up to a full word from a bit string which may
      extend across word boundaries. SETBYT is the inverse
      of GETBYT.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: GETBYT, SETBYT
      Internal Entry Names: SHRERR
      Files Referenced: Printer
    

Usage:


    CALL GETBYT(ADDR,IBEG,ILEN,IRES)



        ADDR
      

        Name of an array containing the desired group of bits.
      

        IBEG
      

        The bit position within ADDR of the left-most bit
        of the group (bits are numbered starting at 1 with the
        left-most or most significant bit in ADDR(1)).
      

        ILEN
      

        Length of the group in bits (at most one word).
      

        IRES
      

        Will contain the desired group, right-justified and
        zero-filled.
      


    CALL SETBYT(ADDR,IBEG,ILEN,IBYT)


      causes the ILEN right-most bits of IBYT to
      replace the group of bits of length ILEN starting at
      the IBEG-th bit in the array ADDR (bits are
      numbered starting at 1 with the left-most or most significant
      bit in ADDR(1)). Replacement goes across word
      boundaries, i.e. the most significant (left-most) bit of
      ADDR(N+1) is adjacent to the least significant
      (right-most) bit of ADDR(N).
    

Error handling:


      Calling either GETBYT or SETBYT with
       or  the number of bits in one word (errors) will
      result in a diagnostic message. After more than 20 such
      errors the job will come to a STOP.
    

Examples:


      IBM:
      If ADDR(1) and ADDR(2) contain the 32-bit
      configurations '0...001110001' and
      '110100...0' respectively, then
    

    CALL GETBYT(ADDR,27,10,IRES)


      will set IRES to '0...001100011101' or
      decimal 797.
    

      If IBYT contains the integer value 3 (binary
      '11') and  ,
      then
    

    CALL SETBYT(ADDR,32,2,IBYT)


      will set ADDR(1) to 0...001' and
      ADDR(2) to '100...0'.
