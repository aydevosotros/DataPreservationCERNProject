LOCBYT searches through a vector in steps of 1 or
      more words looking for the first word which has a certain bit
      configuration in a certain part of the word.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Names: LOCBYT


Usage:


    J = LOCBYT(IT,VECT,N,INC,L,NBITS)


      searches through the N element vector VECT,
      but only looking every INC words for the first word
      which contains IT in the byte (L,NBITS),
      and returns its address in J which may be
      1, INC+1, 2*INC+1,
      3*INC+1, etc.
    

IT must contain the desired byte value
      right-justified with zero-fill.
    

 is returned if
      such a word is not found, or if 
      .
    

      The byte (L,NBITS) is a byte of NBITS bits,
      occupying the bits L,L+1,...,L+NBITS-1. The bits are
      numbered as with the routines of BITBYT (M421) /
      PACBYT (M422):  ; bit
      1 is the least significant bit of the word.
