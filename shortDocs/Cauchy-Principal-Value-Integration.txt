      Function subprograms RCAUCH and DCAUCH
      compute the Cauchy principal value integral
    




      where f has a singularity inside or outside the
      interval [A,B] such that the Cauchy
      principal value exists.
    

      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision version DCAUCH is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RCAUCH is available.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    tCAUCH(F,A,B,S,EPS)


      has, in any arithmetic expression, the approximate value of
      the integral I.
    


        F
      

        (type according to t) Name of a user-supplied
        FUNCTION subprogram, declared EXTERNAL in
        the calling program. This subprogram must set  .
      

        A,B
      

        (type according to t) End-points of the
        integration interval. Note that B may be less than
        A.
      

        S
      

        (type according to t) The absissa of the
        singularity.
      

        EPS
      

        (type according to t) Accuracy parameter (see
        under Accuracy in the in short write-up for
        GAUSS (D103)).
      


Method:


      The method described in Ref. 1 is used for decomposition of
      the integral. The resulting integrals are computed by
      GAUSS (D103).
    

Accuracy:


      See short write-up for GAUSS (D103).
    

Error handling:


      Error D104.1:  or
       .
      Error D104.2: The requested accuracy cannot be
      obtained (see short write-up for GAUSS
      (D103)).
      The function value is set equal to zero, and a message is
      written on Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET
      (N002) has been called.
