      Function subprogram PROBKL calculates the Kolmogorov
      distribution function
    




      for real arguments X.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Name: PROBKL


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


PROBKL(X) has the value  ,
      


      where PROBKL and X are of type
      REAL.
    

Method:


      Direct evaluation or using functional relations.
    

Accuracy:


      Approximately seven digits are correct. Results smaller than
       (corresponding to
      X > 6.8116) are set to zero. Note that the above
      formula has a statistical meaning only for "large" N
      (>10).
    

Notes:


For an experimental distribution with N events
      and a maximum deviation  from
      a hypothetical distribution, 
         with  gives the
        confidence level for the null hypothesis.
      
To compare two experimental distributions with M
      and N events, respectively, one may use
         .
