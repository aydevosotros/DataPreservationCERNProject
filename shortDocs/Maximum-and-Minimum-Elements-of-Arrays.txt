      Function subprograms MAXIZE, MAXRZE,
      MAXDFZ and MINIZE, MINRZE,
      MINDFZ give give the positions of the maximum and
      minimum elements of a one-dimensional array.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision versions
      MAXDZE and MINDZE are not available.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: MAXIZE, MAXRZE, MAXDZE, MINIZE, MINRZE, MINDZE
      Obsolete User Entry Names: MAXFZE 
MAXRZE, MINFZE 
MINRZE


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression, for 
      (type INTEGER),  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    


MAXtZE(A(J),N) and MINtZE(A(J),N)



      has the INTEGER value of the location of,
      respectively, the maximum and minimum elements of the
      N successive elements of the array A,
      relative to the element A(J), where
      A is of type t.
    

Notes:


If there is more than one location at which the maximum
      or minimum is attained, the first location is returned as the
      function value in each case.
      
If  the function
      value is 1.
      
Clearly, N+J should not exceed the dimension of
      the array A.
      
The obsolete older entries MAXFZE (for
      MAXRZE) and MINFZE (for MINRZE)
      are kept for a transitional period. They will eventually
      disappear.
