          Language: Fortran (IBM: Assembler)

      Performs logical search and data movement operations on
      sparse vectors. On Cray systems these routines are part of
      the default libraries (scilib). An optimized Assembler
      version is provided for IBM 3090 with Vector Facilities.
      Fortran code is used on the other systems.

Usage:


      The arguments in the calling sequences below are defined as
      follows:
    


        A,B
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional arrays.
      

        IA,INDX
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional arrays.
      

        LA
      

        (LOGICAL) One-dimensional array.
      

        NW,INC
      

        (INTEGER) Variables or expressions.
      

        TARG
      

        (REAL) Variable or expression.
      

        ITARG,NFOUND
      

        (INTEGER) Variables.
      


      In any arithmetic expression,
    

    IILZ(NW,A,INC)


      represents the INTEGER number of leading zero
      elements in
 ;
    

    ILSUM(NW,LA,INC)


      represents the INTEGER number of .TRUE.
      elements in
 .
    

    CALL SCATTER(NW,A,INDX,B)
    CALL GATHER(NW,A,B,INDX)


      set  and  , respectively.
    

    CALL WHENFxx(NW,A,INC,TARG,INDX,NFOUND)


      searches  for elements
      which satisfy the relation A(.).xx.TARG where
       . On exit,
       will contain the
      indices of the NFOUND elements which satisfy the
      relation specified.
    

    CALL WHENIxx(NW,IA,INC,ITARG,INDX,NFOUND)


      performes the same task as WHENFxx but for
      INTEGER draw and target.
    

    CALL WHENEQ(NW,a,INC,targ,INDX,NFOUND)
    CALL WHENNE(NW,a,INC,targ,INDX,NFOUND)


      performs the same task as WHENFxx or
      WHENIxx, but for  ,
      and REAL draw a and REAL target
      targ, or INTEGER draw a and
      INTEGER target targ, respectively.
