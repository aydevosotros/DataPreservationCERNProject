      Function subprograms ASINH and DASINH
      calculate the hyperbolic arcsine
    




      for real argument x.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double precision version
      DASINH is not available
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: ASINH, DASINH


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


ASINH(X) or DASINH(X) has the value
         ,
      


      where ASINH is of type REAL,
      DASINH is of type DOUBLE PRECISION, and
      X has the same type as the function name.
    

Method:


      Approximation by truncated Chebyshev series and functional
      relations.
    

Accuracy:


ASINH (except on CDC and Cray computers) has full
      single-precision accuracy. For most values of the argument
      X, DASINH (and ASINH on CDC and
      Cray computers) has an accuracy of approximately one
      significant digit less than the machine precision.
