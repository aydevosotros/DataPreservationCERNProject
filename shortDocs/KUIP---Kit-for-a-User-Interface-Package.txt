      The KUIP package is part of PAW (Q121)
      (Physics Analysis Workstation), but can be used
      independently. KUIP is an interface program for any
      application based on interactive input of commands. From the
      application it is seen as a slave which supplies the next
      command with its associated parameters. It takes care of
      program input in various (e.g., graphics or menu) forms and
      performs preliminary checking on command syntax and
      parameters.
