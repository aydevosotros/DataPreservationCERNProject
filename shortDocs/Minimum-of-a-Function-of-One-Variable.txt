      Subroutine subprograms RMINFC and DMINFC
      calculate, to a limited specified accuracy, the abscissa of a
      single local minimum of a real-valued function
      f(x) lying in a given interval
      (a,b), together with the function value at
      the minimum. Although this subprogram may find a minimum
      under other conditions (see Notes), the
      search interval should contain exactly one local minimum
      point x with a<x<b.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DMINFC is not available.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprograms
      User Entry Names: RMINFC, DMINFC
      External References: User-supplied FUNCTION
      subprogram
    

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tMINFC(F,A,B,EPS,DELTA,X,Y,LLM)



        F
      

        (type according to t) Name of a user-supplied
        FUNCTION subprogram, declared EXTERNAL in
        the calling program. This function must set  .
      

        A,B
      

        (type according to t) On entry, A and
        B must specify the end-points
        a,b of the search interval.
      

        EPS
      

        (type according to t) On entry, EPS must
        be equal to the accuracy parameter  (see Accuracy).
      

        DELTA
      

        (type according to t) On entry, DELTA
        must be equal to the parameter  specifying a tolerance interval near
        A and B (see Accuracy).
      

        X
      

        (type according to t) On exit, X is the
        computed approximation to the abscissa of a minimum of the
        function f(x).
      

        Y
      

        (type according to t) Contains, on exit, the value
        of  .
      

        LLM
      

        (LOGICAL) On exit, LLM is .TRUE.
        if the relations  and
         are both true
        (i.e. if X is the abscissa of a local minimum
        lying inside the interval  ), and .FALSE. otherwise (see
        Notes).
      


Method:


      The so-called golden section search is applied (see
      References). This method uses a fixed number
      n of function evaluations, where  .
    

Accuracy:


      The accuracy depends on the behaviour of the function and is
      difficult to measure. For example, a flat minimum results in
      poor accuracy. This implies that the subprograms are not
      intended to replace the usual procedures when a minimum of a
      function is needed in the exact mathematical sense. In any
      case, a choice of  in
      double-precision and of  in
      single-precision mode usually results in a relative error of
      X which is smaller than or in the order of
       . A suggested
      value of  is  .
    

Notes:


As a rule, the specified interval (a,b)
      should contain strictly one local minimum.
      
If this is not the case, and if f(x) is
      monotonous in (a,b), the subprograms find
      the minimum at the correct endpoint a or b.
      LLM is set to .FALSE. in this case.
      
In all other possible cases, the behaviour of the
      subprograms is not easy to predict. In particular, in the
      case of several minimal points inside
      (a,b), one of them is found, but not
      necessarily the one with the smallest value of the function.
