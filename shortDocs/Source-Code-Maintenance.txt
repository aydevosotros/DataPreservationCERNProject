PATCHY and the associated auxiliary programs serve
      in development, maintenance, and inter-computer transport of
      source programs. Suitably structured source files containing
      several versions of a given program permit code selection and
      code modification (down to single-statement-level) by simple
      control cards to YPATCHY. Compacting and structuring
      of card files for efficiency (YTOBIN), maintenance
      of compacted files at the deck level (YEDIT),
      creation of machine-independent, transportable files
      (YTOCETA) and listing of compacted files
      (YLIST) and others are simple auxiliary operations
      in this environment.
    

Structure:


      Complete programs; executable modules exist on all machines
      at CERN where the CERN Program Library is installed, normally
      in the directory /cern/pro/bin.
