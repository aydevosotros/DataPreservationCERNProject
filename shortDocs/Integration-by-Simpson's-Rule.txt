      Function subprograms SIMPS and DSIMPS use
      Simpson's rule to compute an approximate value of the
      integral
    




      On CDC or Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DSIMPS is not available.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: SIMPS, DSIMPS
      Files Referenced: Unit 6
      External References: MTLMTR,
      ABEND


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


SIMPS(F,A,B,N) or DSIMPS(F,A,B,N)



      has the approximate value of the integral I, where
      SIMPS is of type REAL and DSIMPS
      is of type DOUBLE PRECISION, and F,
      A, B have the same type as the function
      name. N is of type INTEGER.
    


        F
      

        One-dimensional array with dimension (0:d), where
         , containing the
        value of f(x) at  equally-spaced points  , with  and
         .
      

        A,B
      

        End-points of integration interval.
      

        N
      

        As defined above. N must be positive and even.
      


Error handling:


      Error D101.1:  or
       odd. The function
      value is set equal to zero, and a message is written on
      Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has
      been called.
