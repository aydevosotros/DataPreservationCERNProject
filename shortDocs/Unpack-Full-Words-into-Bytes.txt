BLOW converts a source array containing a record
      consisting of a continuous string of NBYTES bytes of
      NBITS bits per byte into a target array of
      NBYTES full words, right-adjusted with zero-fill.
      BLOW is the inverse of BUNCH (M436).
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: BLOW
      External References: UPKCH


Usage:


    CALL BLOW(SOURCE,TARGET,NBYTES,NBITS)



        SOURCE
      

        Source array containing the string of NBYTES
        bytes.
      

        TARGET
      

        Target array, which must be at least NBYTES full
        words long.
      

        NBYTES
      

        Number of bytes in the source record (  ).
      

        NBITS
      

        Number of bits per byte (  , where  on
        CDC and  on IBM).
      


Restrictions:


      The two arrays SOURCE and TARGET must not
      overlap in any way.
    

Error handling:


BLOW ignores calls with erroneous parameter values.
    

Examples:


      CDC:
    

    CALL BLOW(SOURCE,TARGET,200,18)


      The array SOURCE contains a record of 200 18-bit
      bytes, stored contiguously in 60 60-bit words, i.e., a string
      of 3600 bits. After the completion of the call to
      BLOW, the array TARGET will contain 200
      60-bit words, each containing one 18-bit byte,
      right-justified with zero-fill.
