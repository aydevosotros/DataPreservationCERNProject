      Given a vector of values Y measured at the points
      X, LFIT and LFITW find the best
      least-squares fit to the linear relationship
      Y=aX+b. LFIT performs an
      unweighted fit and LFITW takes account of a given
      vector of weights. Both subroutines have an option for
      skipping missing points without shifting the points of the
      vector X.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: LFIT,
      LFITW


Usage:



CALL LFIT(X,Y,L,KEY,A,B,VAR) or
      

CALL LFITW(X,Y,W,L,KEY,A,B,VAR)




        X
      

        (REAL) Vector of abscissae.
      

        Y
      

        (REAL) Vector of values corresponding to points
        X.
      

        W
      

        (REAL) Vector of weights (for LFITW
        only).
      

        L
      

        (INTEGER) Length of vectors X, Y
        and W.
      

        KEY
      

        (INTEGER)
 indicates that
        any points where  are to be
        skipped,
 indicates that
        all L points are to be used.
      

        A
      

        (REAL) Fitted slope a.
      

        B
      

        (REAL) Fitted constant term b.
      

        VAR
      

        (REAL) Residual sum of squares divided by (
         ) indicating the
        badness of fit.
