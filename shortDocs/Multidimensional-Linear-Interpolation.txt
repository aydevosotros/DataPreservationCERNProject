      Function subprogram FINT uses repeated linear
      interpolation to evaluate a function  ) of n variables which has been
      tabulated at the nodes of an n-dimensional
      rectangular grid. It is not necessary that the table
      arguments corresponding to any coordinate  be equally spaced.

Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


FINT(N,X,NA,A,F)



      has an approximate value of  .
    


        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number of coordinates n
        required to define the function f.
      

        X
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array.  , must contain the coordinates of the
        point at which the interpolation is to be performed.
      

        NA
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional array. For  must be equal
        to the number of numerical values of variable  which are
        stored in array A.
      

        A
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of length not less
        than the sum of  . The first
        NA(1) elements of A must contain
        numerical values  of the
        first variable  in strictly
        increasing order, the next NA(2) elements of
        A must contain numerical values  of the second variable  in strictly increasing order, and so on.
      

        F
      

        (REAL) Multidimensional array with dimensions
        NA(1), NA(2), ...,NA(N), containing
        values of the function f at the nodes of the
        rectangular grid defined by A:
 .
      


      If any coordinate  of the given
      point X lies outside the range of the corresponding
      table arguments, the interpolation for this coordinate is
      replaced by an extrapolation based on the two nearest table
      arguments, with consequent loss of accuracy.
    

Method:


      Repeated linear interpolation with respect to variables
       within the grid
      cell which contains the given point X. For
      n=2, with  replaced by
      (x,y) for clarity, the procedure is
      equivalent to the following:
    

      Let  be the tabulated
      values of x. Let  be
      the tabulated values of y.
      Let i and j be the subscripts for which
       .
      Then compute:
    




Restrictions:



 .
        FINT is set equal to zero if N is not in
        this range.
      



The table arguments for each variable must be in strictly
      increasing order.
      


      There is no test for conditions 2 or 3.
    

Error handling:


E104.1:  or
       . FINT
      is set equal to zero, and a message is printed unless
      subroutine KERSET (N001) has been called.
    

Examples:


      Given a function of two variables
      g(x,y) defined by a
      FUNCTION subprogram G, to construct a table
      of values of  for  , and to
      interpolate in this table to set GINT equal to an
      approximate value of g(1.7,2.9). The program is
      written in a form which allows generalization to functions of
      more than two variables.
