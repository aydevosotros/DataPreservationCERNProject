RIWIAD is an adaptive multidimensional integration
      subroutine based on an original by G. Sheppey. It permits
      numerical integration of a large class of functions, in
      particular those that are irregular at the border of the
      integration region. The integral is always performed over the
      unit hypercube.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: RIWIAD
      Files Referenced: Unit 6
      External References: RNDM
      user-supplied FUNCTION subprogram
COMMON Block Names and Lengths:
    









/ANSWER/ 2,
        

/INTERN/ 7,
        

/OPTION/ 3,
        

/PARAMS/ 4,
        




/RANDOM/ 1,
        

/STORE/ 77,

Usage:


      See Long Write-up for a description of all
      features. Here only the standard use is described.
    

      The COMMON block PARAMS must always be set
      by the user:
    


COMMON /PARAMS/ ACC,NDIM,NSUB,ITER




        ACC
      

        (REAL) Relative accuracy desired.
      

        NDIM
      

        (INTEGER) Number of dimension parameters.
      

        NSUB
      

        (INTEGER) Number of subvolumes allowed.
      

        ITER
      

        (INTEGER) Maximal number of iterations.
      


      The integrand is defined by a user-supplied FUNCTION
      subprogram having the array Q(NDIM) as parameter,
      for example
    

    FUNCTION EXAMPLE(Q)
    REAL EXAMPLE,Q
    DIMENSION Q(7)
    ...
    END


      This program defines EXAMPLE as a function of the 7
      variables  . The sequence
    

    EXTERNAL EXAMPLE
    COMMON /PARAMS/ ACC,NDIM,NSUB,ITER
    ACC=0.01
    NDIM=7
    NSUB=10000
    ITER=5
    CALL RIWIAD(EXAMPLE)
    ...


      will then integrate EXAMPLE over the 7 variables
       , all in the
      interval from 0 to 1, i.e. over the 7-dimensional unit
      hypercube. The result will be printed in detail in a readily
      understandable form.
    

      The program allows extensive user control via the
      COMMON blocks. See Long Write-up
      for details.
    

Method:


RIWIAD is iterative and in a given iteration it
      divides the unit hypercube into a certain number of
      subvolumes by means of a given set of intervals on each axis.
      Within each subvolume it estimates the mean value and
      variance of the integrand by random sampling, and then
      calculates the Riemann sum over the subvolumes. Using the
      variances found projected onto each axis it calculates a set
      of new interval divisions to be used in the next iteration.
      It returns when the desired accuracy is obtained or when the
      maximum number of iterations has been performed.
    

Restrictions:


      There is, in principle, no limitations on the number of
      dimensions, although the present version only allows up to
      9-dimensional integrals. The maximal dimensionality can
      easily be increased.
    

Notes:


The program is rather slow and should preferably be used
      only when other methods (for instance Gaussian quadrature)
      fail due to the irregular behaviour of the integrand. The
      time consumption is essentially proportional to the product
      of NSUB and ITER.
      
The non-CDC/Cray implementation of RIWIAD has
      IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION(A-H,O-Z), i.e. all
      non-INTEGER variables are DOUBLE PRECISION,
      including the user-supplied external function.
