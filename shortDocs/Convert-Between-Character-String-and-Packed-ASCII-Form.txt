IFROMC and CFROMI provide a simple,
      portable facility for storing character strings of 1-4
      characters packed into integers.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: IFROMC, FROMI
      External References: CHTOI,
      ITOCH


Usage:


    I=IFROMC('string')


      stores in I a packed ASCII representation
      of the 4 leftmost characters of 'string'. If there
      are fewer than 4 characters, blanks are stored in the empty
      positions.
    

    CHARACTER*4 STRING
    ...
    STRING=CFROMI(I)


      stores in STRING the four characters stored packed
      in I in their ASCII representation.
