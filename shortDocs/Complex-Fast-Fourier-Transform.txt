      Subroutine CFSTFT calculates the finite Fourier
      transform of a complex periodic sequence  , whose period n must be a power of
      two. Either the direct transform
    




      or the unscaled inverse transform
    




      where  and  are complex numbers, may be calculated.
    

      If the  in (2) have the
      values defined by (1), then 
      . To ensure optimum use of storage, the same array is used
      for input and output, and all intermediate calculations are
      carried out in this array.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: CFSTFT


Usage:


    CALL CFSTFT(M,A)



        M
      

        (INTEGER) On entry, n is determined by
        the absolute value of M via  .
 The direct
        transform (1) is calculated.
 The inverse
        transform (2) is calculated.

        (COMPLEX) One dimensional array of dimension
        (0:d), where 
        .

        On entry,  .
        On exit,  , as defined
        by (1).

        On entry,  .
        On exit,  , as defined
        by (2).
      


Method:


      The method is based on an algorithm of Cooley, Lewis and
      Welch (see References), with the following
      modifications which increase speed for small values of
      M: multiplications by  are replaced by addition or subtraction, and
      terms of the form  are
      calculated recursively using only square roots and divisions.
