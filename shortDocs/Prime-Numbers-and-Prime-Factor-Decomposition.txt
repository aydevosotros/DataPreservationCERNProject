      Subroutine subprogram PRMFCT


sets the first  prime
        numbers  into an array;
      
performs the decomposition of a positive number
      N<10007 into its prime factors:
        



performs the decomposition of the factorial N!
      of a positive number N<10007 into its prime
      factors:
        





      Note that this allows in particular to handle quotients of
      factorials of rather large numbers in an exact way.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: PRMFCT
      Files Referenced: Unit 6


Usage:


    CALL PRMFCT(MODE,N,NPRIME,NPOWER,M)


 Sets the first
      n prime numbers into an array.
    


        N
      

        (INTEGER) The number n of prime numbers
        requested.
      

        NPRIME
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional array of length
         . On exit,
        NPRIME(j), (  )
        contains the j-th prime numbers  , where 


        NPOWER
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional array of length
         . On exit,
        NPOWER(j), (  )
        contains the value 1.
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) Contains, on exit, the number
        n.
      


 Performs the
      decomposition of N (  ) or N! (  ) into its prime factors.
    


        N
      

        (INTEGER) The number N itself (
         ) or its
        factorial (  ) to be
        decomposed into prime factors.
      

        NPRIME
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional array of length
         . On exit,
        NPRIME(j), (  )
        contains the j-th prime numbers  , where  .
      

        NPOWER
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional array of length
         . On exit,
        NPOWER(j), (  )
        contains the power 
        corresponding to the prime number  .
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) Contains, on exit, the index  defined by
         and
         for
        j>M.
      


Restrictions:


  .
 or   .
    

Error handling:


      Error B002.1:  and
       and  .
      Error B002.2:  out
      of range.
      In both cases, NPRIME(j) and NPOWER(j), (
       ) are set to
      zero and a message is written on
      [4] Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET (N002)
      has been called.
