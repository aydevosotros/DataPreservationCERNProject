      The concept string of n Hollerith characters is
      machine independent, but its usual representation in
      Am format (with m = character capacity of a
      machine word: A10, A8, A6,
      A4) is not.
    

      Supposing any computer to have a character capacity of at
      least A4, string representations in A4,
      A3, A2 or A1 are transportable.
      Representations A1 and A4 are particularly
      interesting.
    

      Fortran 77 defines a new data type CHARACTER though
      most compilers also support Hollerith strings (without a
      clear definition of the differences). A set of routines has
      been added to this package in its Fortran 77 implementation
      to convert between CHARACTER strings and Hollerith
      strings.
    

      The routines UBLOW, UBUNCH and
      UTRANS work on Hollerith only and so should
      be considered obsolete, while UCTOH,
      UCTOH1 and UHTOC and UH1TOC copy
      between CHARACTER and Hollerith. Unpredictable
      results will be obtained if wrong data types are passed to
      these routines. On most machines text strings passed in
      quotes are implicitly of type CHARACTER while a
      string preceeded by nH is not.
    

      The routines of this package perform transformations between
      different representations.

        Output vector, continuous string of NCH Hollerith
        characters in Am form (i.e. A10,

Error handling:


 acts as
      do-nothing.
    

Examples:


      (b = blank).
    

1)    CALL UBLOW(11HABCDEFGHIJK,V,11)


      fills V:  , with blank
      padding of each word.
    

2)    CALL UBUNCH(V,X,11)


      gives the inverse transformation, thus on the CDC 7600
       :
    

      X(1) = 10ABCDEFGHIJ, X(2) = 10HKbbbbbbbb


3)    CALL UTRANS(X,Y,11,99,4)


      copies the continuous X string to A4
      representation in Y:
    

      Y(1) = 4HABCD, Y(2) = 4HEFGH, Y(3) = 4HIJKb


      with blank padding if  .
    

4)    CALL UTRANS(Y,X,11,4,99)


      gives the inverse of example 3).


5)    CALL UTRANS(V,X,11,1,99)


      gives the same result as example 2), but is much
      slower.
    

6)    DIMENSION V(4)
      CHARACTER*14 C/'THIS IS A TEST'/
      CALL UCTOH(C,V,4,14)


      copies the CHARACTER string in C into
      V such that
    

      V(1) = 4HTHIS, V(2) = 4HbISb, V(3) = 4HAbTE, V(4) = 4HSTbb


7)    DIMENSION V(4)
      CHARACTER*14 C
      DATA V /14HTHIS IS A TEST/   or   DATA V /4HTHIS,4H IS ,4HA TE,2HST/
      CALL UHTOC(V,4,C,14)


      copies the Hollerith strings in V into C
      such that C='THIS IS A TEST'.
    

8)    DIMENSION V(4)
      CHARACTER*4 C/'TEST'/
      CALL UCTOH1(C,V,4)


      copies the CHARACTER-string in C into
      V such that
    

      V(1) = 4HTbbb, V(2) = 4HEbbb, V(3) = 4HSbbb, V(4) = 4HTbbb


9)    DIMENSION V(4)
      CHARACTER*4 C
      DATA V/1HT,1HE,1HS,1HT/
      CALL UH1TOC(V,C,4)


      copies the Hollerith characters in V into the
      CHARACTER string C such that
      C='TEST'.
