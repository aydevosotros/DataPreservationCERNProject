      Subroutine RFSTFT calculates the finite Fourier
      transform of a real periodic sequence  , whose period n must be a power of
      two. Either the direct transform
    




      or the inverse transform
    




      where  are real and
       are complex
      numbers, may be calculated. Note that  , where 
      denotes the complex conjugate of  . Thus, only the numbers  for which  are
      calculated.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: RFSTFT
      External References: CFSTFT


Usage:


    COMPLEX C(0:..)
    REAL Y(0:..)
    EQUIVALENCE (C,Y)
    ...
    CALL RFSTFT(M,C)
    ...



        M
      

        (INTEGER) On entry, n is determined by
        the absolute value of M via  .
 The direct
        transform (1) is calculated.
 The inverse
        transform (2) is calculated.
        Unchanged on exit.

        (COMPLEX) One dimensional array of dimension
        (0:d), where  .
      

        Y
      

        (REAL) One dimensional array of dimension
        (0:d), where 
        .

        On entry,  .
        On exit,  , as defined
        by (1).

        On entry,  .
        On exit,  , as defined
        by (2).
      


Method:


      The subroutine uses CFSTFT (D705) with sequences
      reduced to half of their length as explaind in Ref. 1.
