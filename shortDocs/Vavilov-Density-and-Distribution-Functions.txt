      The VVILOV package contains subprograms for the
      calculation of the Vavilov density and distribution
      functions. Though generally more accurate, these routines are
      considerably slower than those in VAVLOV (G115).
    

      For  and  , the Vavilov density function is
      mathematically defined by
    




      where c is an arbitrary real constant and
    




 is the
      exponential integral,  ,
      and  is Euler's
      constant.
    

      The Vavilov distribution function is defined by

Usage:


    CALL VVISET(RKAPPA,BETA2,MODE,XL,XU)


      sets auxiliary quantities used in VVIDEN and
      VVIDIS; this call has to precede a reference to
      either of these entries.
    


        RKAPPA
      

        The variable  (the straggling
        parameter); (  ).
      

        BETA2
      

        The variable  (the
        square of velocity in unit c); (  ).
      

        MODE
      

 if
        VVIDEN is referenced after the call to
        VVISET;
 if
        VVIDIS is referenced after the call to
        VVISET.
      

        XL,XU
      

        On exit, XL and XU contain a lower and
        upper limit as defined below.
      


      In any arithmetic expression,
    








VVIDEN(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          



VVIDIS(X)


            has the value
          

 ,
          




      By definition
    















            if
          

 ;
          






            if
          

 ;
          






            if
          

 ;
          






            if
          

 .
          




RKAPPA, BETA2, XL and XU
      are defined by the last call to VVISET (with
       ) prior to a
      reference to VVIDEN, or (with  ) prior to a reference to VVIDIS.
    

VVIDEN, VVIDIS and X,
      RKAPPA, BETA2, XL, XU are
      of type REAL, and MODE is of type
      INTEGER.
    

Method:


      The method, based on Fourier expansions, is described in Ref.
      1.
    

Accuracy:


      About five significant digits are usually accurate.
    

Error handling:


      Error G116.1:  or
       .
      Error G116.2: 
      .
      These errors can occur when calling VVISET. In both
      cases, a message is written on Unit 6, unless
      subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been called.
    

Notes:


Representing the Vavilov functions by approximations
      which are both fast and accurate is a difficult task. These
      routines, though rather accurate, are slow. If speed is of
      higher importance than accuracy, and for calculating Vavilov
      random numbers, use VAVLOV (G115).
      
For  , the Vavilov
      distribution can be replaced by the Landau distribution
      (LANDAU (G110)), taking into account that
         .
      
For  , the Vavilov
      distribution can be replaced by the Gaussian distribution
      with mean
 and variance
         .
