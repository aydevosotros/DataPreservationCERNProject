      Function subprograms RBINOM and DBINOM
      calculate the binomial coefficient
    




      for real x and integer k. Function
      subprogram KBINOM calculates the binomial
      coefficient only for integer x=n.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DBINOM is not available.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: RBINOM, DBINOM, KBINOM
      Obsolete User Entry Names: BINOM 
RBINOM
      Files Referenced: Unit 6


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


RBINOM(X,K), DBINOM(X,K) or
        KBINOM(N,K)



      has the value of the binomial coefficient. RBINOM is
      of type REAL, DBINOM is of type DOUBLE
      PRECISION and X has the same type as the
      function name. KBINOM, N and K are of type
      INTEGER.
    

Restrictions:


      Function subprogram KBINOM can compute only binomial
      coefficients which lie in the integer range of the machine.
    

Accuracy:


      Full machine accuracy.
    

Error handling:


      If the result of KBINOM would lie outside the
      integer range of the machine, KBINOM is set equal to
      zero and an error message is printed.
