      Subroutine subprograms RGS56P and DGS56P
      calculate an approximation and uncertainty for the integral
    




      equal respectively to the mean value and the difference of
      the results  and  obtained by the five- and six-point
      Gaussian integration rules.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DGS56P is not available.

      subprogram.
    

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tGS56P(F,A,B,RES,ERR)



        F
      

        (type according to t) Name of a user-supplied
        FUNCTION subprogram, declared EXTERNAL in
        the calling program. This subprogram must set  .
      

        A,B
      

        (type according to t) End-points of integration
        interval. Note that B may be less than A.
      

        RES
      

        (type according to t) The calculated approximation
        for I, i.e.  ,
      

        ERR
      

        (type according to t) An estimated uncertainty on
        this approximation, i.e.  .
