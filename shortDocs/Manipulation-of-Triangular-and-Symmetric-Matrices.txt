      At CERN, matrices are often stored row-wise (TC-convention);
      furthermore, symmetric matrices are stored packed as the
      lower left triangular part only, i.e., the Ith
      diagonal element is found in position
      I(I+1)/2. The TR-package performs
      many of the frequently required operations associated with
      such matrices without resorting to expanding into the
      unpacked square form. In all the following routines an
      
symmetric matrix is taken to be stored in the packed
      form with M(M+1)/2 elements.
    

      Some of these operations produce and require the manipulation
      of lower triangular matrices which have all elements
      zero above the leading diagonal. These are also stored in the
      packed form with all the zeros dropped; therefore, care has
      to be taken in the interpretation of a packed matrix as to
      whether it represents a symmetric or lower triangular array.
      To facilitate this distinction in the Write-up, the following
      nomenclature has been adopted:
    


        A,B,C
      

        unpacked rectangular matrices (row-wise storage)
      

        Q,R,S,T
      

        packed symmetric matrices
      

        V,W
      

        packed lower triangular matrices
      


      On 32-bit machines the calculations are performed internally
      in double-precision mode.

Usage:


Choleski Decomposition









CALL TRCHUL(S,W,M)









CALL TRCHLU(S,V,M)









S is an  positive
      semi-definite symmetric matrix (e.g., error or weight
      matrix) and the routines calculate the complementary lower
      triangular Choleski factors. It is allowed to overwrite
      S by W or V.
    

Symmetric Multiplication of Lower Triangular
      Matrices











CALL TRSMUL(W,S,M)









S





CALL TRSMLU(W,R,M)









R





W is an  lower
      triangular matrix and S, R the two
      symmetric products of the multiplication of W by its
      transpose. It is allowed to overwrite W by either
      S or R.
    

Lower Triangular Matrix Inversion











CALL TRINV(W,V,M)









V





W is an  lower
      triangular matrix which is inverted into V (the
      inverse of a lower triangular matrix is lower triangular).
      W may have rows and columns of zeros as
      produced by the Choleski decomposition of a weight matrix
      with unmeasured variables. It is allowed to overwrite
      W by V.
    

Symmetric Matrix Inversion











CALL TRSINV(S,R,M)









R





S is an  positive
      semi-definite symmetric matrix which is inverted into
      R (also stored packed). It is permissible to
      overwrite S by R.
    

Triangular - Rectangular
      Multiplication











CALL TRLA (W,A,B,M,N)









B





CALL TRLTA(W,A,B,M,N)









B





CALL TRAL (A,V,B,M,N)



AV





B





CALL TRALT(A,V,B,M,N)









B





A and B are  rectangular matrices, W is an
       lower triangular
      matrix, and V is an  lower triangular matrix. In each call it is
      allowed to overwrite A by B.
    

Symmetric - Rectangular Multiplication











CALL TRSA (S,A,C,M,N)



SA





C





CALL TRAS (A,R,C,M,N)



AR





C





CALL TRSAT(S,B,C,M,N)









C





CALL TRATS(B,R,C,M,N)









C





A and C are  rectangular matrices, B is an
       matrix,
      S is an  symmetrix
      matrix, and R is an  symmetric matrix. It is not allowed
      to overwrite A or B by the product matrix
      C.
    

Symmetric Multiplication of Rectangular
      Matrices











CALL TRAAT(A,S,M,N)









S





CALL TRATA(B,R,M,N)









R





A is an  matrix,
      B is an  matrix,
      S is an  symmetric
      matrix, and R is an  symmetric matrix. No overwriting is allowed.

CALL TRASAT(A,S,R,M,N)









R





CALL TRATSA(B,S,R,M,N)









R





CALL TRQSQ (Q,T,R,M)



QTQ





R





A is an  matrix,
      B is an  matrix,
      S is an  symmetric
      matrix, and R, Q, T are
       symmetric
      matrices. No overwriting is allowed.

      Matrix

CALL TRUPCK(S,A,M)



S

A is an  unpacked
      symmetric matrix (all 
      elements) and S is the same matrix stored packed.
      Overwriting is allowed for both TRPCK and
      TRUPCK.
