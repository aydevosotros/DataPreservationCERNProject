      Subroutine LSQ fits a polynomial of degree
      m-1 to n equally-weighted data points (
       ). The computed
      coefficients  of the fitted
      polynomial have values which minimize
    




      For the case m=2 (straight line fit), subroutine
      LLSQ is faster and easier to use than LSQ.
    

      Meaningful results can usually be obtained only for small
      values of m (typically less than 10).

Usage:


    CALL LSQ(N,X,Y,M,A)
    CALL LLSQ(N,X,Y,A1,A2,IFAIL)



        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number n of data points.
      

        X
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array. X(i) must
        be equal to the data coordinate  ,
 .
      

        Y
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array. Y(i) must
        be equal to the observed value  ,
 .
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) On entry, M must be equal to
        the number m of coefficients of the polynomial to
        be fitted. On exit, the value of M may differ from
        this (see Error Handling).
      

        A
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array. On exit from
        LSQ, A(j) is equal to the coefficient of
         in the fitted
        polynomial,  .
      

        A1,A2
      

        (REAL) On exit from LLSQ, A1 and
        A2 are equal to the coefficients of the fitted
        straight line  .
      

        IFAIL
      

        (INTEGER) On exit from LLSQ,
        IFAIL is equal to -2 if  , to -1 if the matrix of normal
        equations is numerically singular, and to zero otherwise.
      


Method:


      Normal equations.
    

Error handling:


      Error E208.1:  or
       or  (subroutine LSQ). M is
      replaced by zero.
      Error E208.2: The normal equations matrix is
      numerically singular (subroutine LSQ).
      For each error, a message is printed unless subroutine
      KERSET (N001) has been called.
    

Notes:


      On computers other than Cray and CDC double-precision
      arithmetic is used internally.
