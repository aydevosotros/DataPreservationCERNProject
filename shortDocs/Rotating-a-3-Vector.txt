      Subroutine subprogram ROT rotates a 3-vector
       by a given angle
       around the
      z-axis.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: ROT
COMMON Block Names and Lengths: /SLATE/ 40


Usage:


    CALL ROT(A,TH,B)



        A
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of length 3,
        containing  .
      

        TH
      

        (REAL) Angle 
        given in radians.
      

        B
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of length 3.
        On exit, B contains the components  of the rotated vector, i.e.
      







 .
      


B may overlap A.
