      Subroutine POLINT interpolates in a table of
      arguments  and function
      values  , using an
      interpolating polynomial of specified degree K-1
      which passes through K successive tabular points.
      The table arguments  need
      not be equidistant. Meaningful results can usually be
      obtained only for small values of K (typically less
      than 10).

Usage:


    CALL POLINT(F,A,K,X,R)



        F
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array. F(j) must
        be equal to the value at A(j) of the function to
        be interpolated,  .
      

        A
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array. A(j) must
        be equal to the table argument  .
      

        K
      

        (INTEGER) K-1 is the degree of the
        interpolating polynomial.
      

        X
      

        (REAL) Argument at which the interpolating
        polynomial is to be evaluated.
      

        R
      

        (REAL) On exit, R is set equal to the
        value at X of the polynomial passing through the
        points  .
      


      If X lies outside the range of the points
       , the
      interpolation becomes an extrapolation, with consequent loss
      of accuracy.
    

Method:


      Newton's divided difference formula is used.
    

Restrictions:


 . If  , the interpolation is performed as if
      K had the value 20. The original value of
      K is unchanged on exit.
    

Error handling:


      Error E100.1:  . A
      message is printed unless subroutine KERSET (N001)
      has been called.
    

Notes:


POLINT is intended for interpolation using
      all the tabulated points in the array A. To
      use only the tabulated points around the value of the
      argument X, use DIVDIF (E105).
