GETBIT/SETBIT find or set the value of a single bit
      in a bit-string which may extend across word boundaries.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: GETBIT, SETBIT


Usage:


    CALL GETBIT(I,M,L)
    CALL SETBIT(I,M,L)



        I
      

        Position of the selected bit, starting on the left with 1.
      

        M
      

        A word or an array, considered as a continuous string of
        bits.
      

        L
      

        Integer whose right-most bit will contain the value found
        by GETBIT or the value to be set by
        SETBIT in the I-th position of the
        bit-string starting at the left-most bit of the first word
        of M.
