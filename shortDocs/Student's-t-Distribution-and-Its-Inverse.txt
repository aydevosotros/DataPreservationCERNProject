      Function subprogram STUDIS calculates the value of
      the Student t-distribution function
    




      for a given degrees of freedom 
      .
    

      Function subprogram STUDIN calculates the inverse
      t(F,n).
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Names: STUDIS, STUDIN
      Files Referenced: Printer
      External References: GAUSIN,
      MTLMTR, ABEND


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


STUDIS(T,N) or STUDIN(F,N) has the value
         or  ,
      


      respectively. STUDIS, STUDIN, F
      and T are of type REAL, N is of
      type INTEGER.
    

Error handling:


      Error G104.1: 
      .
      Error G104.2:  or
       .
      In both cases, a message is written on Unit 6,
      unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been called.
    

Accuracy:


      About six decimal places are usually correct. Accuracy is
      lost for STUDIS when  and  .
    

Notes:


      The subprograms are based on algorithms given in the
      references.
