      Subroutine tEQN (where  , D or C as described below)
      solves the matrix equation
    




      which represents a system of N simultaneous linear
      equations with K right-hand sides:
    




      Subroutine tINV computes the inverse of a square
      matrix A. Subroutine tEQINV solves
      the system (*) and also computes the inverse of
      A, but is appreciably slower than
      tEQN.
    

      If the determinant of A is also required, or
      if several systems of the form (*) are to be solved
      sequentially with the same coefficient matrix
      A but differing right-hand sides
      B, the subroutines in RFACT (F011)
      should be used.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),  (type COMPLEX):
    

    CALL tEQN  (N,A,IDIM,IR,IFAIL,K,B)
    CALL tINV  (N,A,IDIM,IR,IFAIL)
    CALL tEQINV(N,A,IDIM,IR,IFAIL,K,B)



        N
      

        (INTEGER) Order of the square matrix
        A.
      

        A
      

        (Type according to t) Two-dimensional array whose
        first dimension has the value IDIM.
      

        IDIM
      

        (INTEGER) First dimension of array A (and
        of array B if  ).
      

        IR
      

        (INTEGER) Array of at least N elements,
        required as working space.
      

        IFAIL
      

        (INTEGER) On exit, IFAIL will be set to
         if
        A is found to be singular, and to
        0 otherwise. (Singularity will often go undetected
        because of rounding errors during factorization even if the
        elements of A have integral values.)
      

        K
      

        (INTEGER) Number of columns of the matrices
        B and X.
      

        B
      

        (Type according to t) In general, a
        two-dimensional array whose first dimension has the value
        IDIM. B may be one-dimensional if
         .
      


      These subroutines must be called with matrix
      A in array A and matrix
      B in array B. Then, provided the
      matrix A is non-singular, IFAIL
      will be set to 0 and arrays A and
      B will be set as follows:
    


        tEQN
      

        The solution X replaces
        B. The matrix A is
        destroyed.
      

        tINV
      

        The inverse  of
        A replaces A.
      

        tEQINV
      

        The solution X replaces
        B, and the inverse  of A replaces
        A.
      


      If the matrix A is singular, IFAIL
      will be set to  . In this
      case the contents of A is unpredictable and the
      contents of B is unchanged.
    

Method:


      Triangular factorization with row interchanges, implemented
      by in-line code if  and by calls
      to library program RFACT (F011) if  . If  or
       or  , a message is printed and program
      execution is terminated by calling ABEND (Z035).
    

Examples:


      Assume that the  matrix
      A and the 
      matrix B are stored according to the Fortran
      convention in arrays A and B respectively
      of a program containing declarations
    

    DIMENSION IR(25)
    DOUBLE PRECISION A(25,30),B(25,10)


      To replace B by the  solution matrix X of the
      system of equations  and
      to replace A by  , with a jump to label 100 if
      A is singular:
    

    CALL DEQINV (10,A,25,IR,IFAIL,3,B)
    IF(IFAIL .NE. 0) GO TO 100
