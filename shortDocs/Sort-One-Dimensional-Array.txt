SORTZV will sort a one-dimensional array containing
      Hollerith or numerical integer or real information. The user
      may specify his own collating sequence for characters;
      otherwise that of the display code will be used. The array to
      be sorted is not changed. The output of SORTZV is an
      integer array containing the ordered indices indicating the
      order of the original array (see Examples).
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: SORTZV


Usage:


      CDC:
    

    CALL SORTZV(A,INDEX,N,MODE,NWAY,NSORT,M,CARSET)


      Others:
    

    CALL SORTZV(A,INDEX,N,MODE,NWAY,NSORT)



        A
      

        One-dimensional array of elements to be sorted.
      

        INDEX
      

        One-dimensional array of indices. After execution it
        contains the indices denoting the desired order of
        A. On input it may contain (depending on
        NSORT) indices denoting which elements of
        A are to be sorted (see
        Examples).
      

        N
      

        Number of words to be sorted.
      

        MODE
      

        Type of sort required:
 Integer,
 Hollerith,
 Real.
      

        NWAY
      

        Order of sort:
 Ascending
        order,
 Descending
        order.
      

        NSORT
      

        Elements to be sorted:
 Sort the first
        N elements of A,
 Sort N
        words of A as indicated by array INDEX.
      

        M
      

        Character set to be used: (CDC only)
 Use display
        code (only applicable to Hollerith sort),
 Use collating
        sequence specified in CARSET  .
      

        CARSET
      

        Defines the collating sequence for a Hollerith sort. This
        array must be at least 64 elements in length. On entering
        SORTZV the K characters for which the
        user wishes to specify the order, must be in the first
        K words of CARSET (one character/word,
        left-adjusted and blank-filled). Any characters found
        during the sort which have not been defined in
        CARSET will be added to CARSET.
      


Restrictions:


      The input order of equal elements is not necessarily
      retained. The parameters M and CARSET are
      only used in the CDC version.
    

Examples:


Assume the array I contains
      0,1,-1,4,-2,0,4,5,7,8. Then the statement
        
    CALL SORTZV(I,INDEX,5,-1,0,0)
(M and CARSET omitted) sets the array 
        INDEX to 5,3,1,2,4.
      
With the same array I and the array
      INDEX containing 1,3,5,6,7,8,
        
    CALL SORTZV(I,INDEX,6,-1,0,1)
sets the array INDEX to 5,3,1,6,7,8.

      Based on an Algol procedure described in Ref. 1.
