      Function subprograms RANF and DRANF return
      pseudo-random values uniformly distributed in the interval
      (0,1), the end points excluded. The multiplicative
      congruential method is used.
    

      Subroutine subprogram RANGET makes the current seed
      value of RANF and DRANF available to the
      user, and subroutine RANSET restores a seed value
      for further use by RANF and DRANF.
    

      On CDC computers, the subprograms other than DRANF
      are part of Control Data's Fortran execution-time library.
    

      The non-CDC versions of RANF and DRANF use
      the same multiplier (2875 A2E7 B175), the same
      initial seed value (2BC6 8CFE 166D), and the same
      modulus (2**48). They thus generate, within the
      limitations of machine accuracy, the same random sequence as
      the CDC versions.
    

DRANF is identical to RANF except that it
      returns a function value of type DOUBLE PRECISION.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE and FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: RANF,
      DRANF, RANGET, RANSET


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


RANF() or DRANF()



      is set to a value greater than zero and less than one.
      RANF is of type REAL, DRANF is of
      type DOUBLE PRECISION.
    

    CALL RANGET(SEED)
    CALL RANSET(SEED)



        SEED
      

        (REAL for CDC, DOUBLE PRECISION
        otherwise). On exit from RANGET,SEED will
        be set to a value that determines the current position in
        the sequence of random numbers. This value may be used
        later as an actual argument in a call to RANSET in
        order to restart the random sequence at this point.
