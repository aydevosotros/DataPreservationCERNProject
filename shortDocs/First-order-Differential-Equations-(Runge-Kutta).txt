      Subroutine subprograms RRKSTP and DRKSTP
      advance the solution of the system of  simultaneous first-order differential equations
    




      by a single step of length h in the independent
      variable x.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DRKSTP is not available.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprograms
      User Entry Names : RKSTP, DRKSTP
      Obsolete User Entry Names : RKSTP 
RRKSTP
      Files Referenced : Unit 6
      External References: user-supplied SUBROUTINE
      subprogram
    

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tRKSTP(N,H,X,Y,SUB,W)



        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number n of equations.
      

        H
      

        (type according to t) The step-length h.
      

        X
      

        (type according to t) On entry, X must be
        equal to the initial value of the independent variable
        x. On exit, X is equal to
        x+h.
      

        Y
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  N. On
        entry,  , must contain
         . On exit,
         , contains
        approximate values  .
      

        SUB
      

        Name of a user-supplied SUBROUTINE subprogram,
        declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
      

        W
      

        (type according to t) Array containing at least
        3*N elements required as working-space.
      


      The user-supplied subroutine SUB should be of the
      form
    

    SUBROUTINE SUB(X,Y,F)


      where the variable X and the one-dimensional arrays
      Y(*) and F(*) are of type t. This
      subroutine must set
    




Method:


      Using boldface quantities to denote vectors of length
      n, the computational sequence is as follows:
    




      The error per step is proportional to  .
    

Error handling:


 acts as do
      nothing.
