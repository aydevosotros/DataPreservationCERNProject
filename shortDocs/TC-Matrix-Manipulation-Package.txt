      The routines of MXPACK compute the product of two
      matrices or the product of their transposed matrices and may
      add or subtract to the resultant matrix a third one, add or
      subtract one matrix from another, or transfer a matrix, its
      negative, or a multiple of it, transpose a given matrix,
      build up a unit matrix, multiply a matrix by a diagonal (from
      left or from right) and may add the result to another matrix,
      add to square matrix the multiple of a diagonal matrix,
      compute the products  (
       denotes the
      transpose of  ) and  . It is assumed that matrices are stored
      row-wise without gaps, contrary to the
      Fortran convention.

Notes:


      In the formulae above, 
etc denotes the ensemble of elements of the matrix
       etc
      with the row index i and the column index
      j. The Fortran variables NI, NJ
      and NK specify the dimensions associated with the
      indices i,j and k. If
      DIMENSION A(NJ,NI) reserves space for the matrix
       , then the
      element  is contained in
      A(J,I).
