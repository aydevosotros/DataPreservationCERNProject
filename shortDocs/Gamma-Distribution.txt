      Function subprogram GAMDIS calculates the gamma
      distribution function (incomplete gamma function)
    




      for real arguments  and a
      > 0.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Name: GAMDIS
      Files Referenced: Unit 6
      External References: GAMMA,
      ALGAMA, MTLMTR, ABEND


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


GAMDIS(X,A) has the value  ,
      


      where GAMDIS, X and A are of type
      REAL.
    

Method:


      The method is described in Ref. 1.
    

Accuracy:


      Approximately six digits are correct.
    

Error handling:


      Error G106.1:  or
       .
      Error G106.2: Difficulties of convergence
      (unlikely).
      The function value is set equal to zero, and a message is
      written on Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET
      (N002) has been called.
    

Notes:


For greater accuracy, or for the case  , use GAPNC (C334). Note,
        however, that in this case the arguments X and
        A must be interchanged.
      
Note that, for integer  ,  , where
        PROB (G100) is the upper tail probability of the
        chi-squared distribution function. PROB (G100) is
        faster than GAMDIS (G106) in this case.
      


      This subprogram is based on a Fortran program for the
      incomplete gamma functions published in Ref. 2.
