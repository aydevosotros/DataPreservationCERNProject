      Function subprograms RTRINT and DTRINT
      compute an approximate value of the integral
    




      evaluated over the interior of an arbitrary triangle
       in the
      xy-plane. An attempted accuracy may, optionally, be
      specified.
    

      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision version DTRINT is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RTRINT is available.

        Accuracy).
      

        X1,Y1

Method:



      An approximation  to
      I is found by computing the NPT-point
      formula for the triangle  .
      The value of EPS has no influence on the
      result.

      After computing  , the
      triangle  is subdivided
      into two subtriangles  and
       , the
      corresponding approximations I' and I'' are
      computed, and a test is made to see whether
    




      If this test is satisfied, the routine terminates by setting
      the function value to  .
      If it fails, the process of subdivision and testing continues
      according to a tree structure. The routine terminates either
      because the test is passed successfully by all the
      subtriangles at some level, or because a maximum number of
      subdivisions is reached (see Error
      Handling).
    

Accuracy:


      Unless there is severe cancellation of positive and negative
      values of f(x,y) over  ,the argument EPS may, if
       , be considered
      as specifying a bound on the relative error of I in
      the case |I|>1, and a bound on the absolute error
      in the case |I|<1.
    

Restrictions:


      "Mild" singularities are permitted if they coincide with the
      vertices of  . Any other
      singularity lying inside  or
      on its boundaries will most likely lead to too many
      subdivisions (see Error Handling), or cause
      a wrong result.
    

Error handling:


      Error D105.1: 
      .
      Error D105.2: The number of subdivisions has reached
      35 without success.
      In both cases, the function value is set equal to zero, and a
      message is written on Unit 6, unless subroutine
      MTLSET (N002) has been called.
