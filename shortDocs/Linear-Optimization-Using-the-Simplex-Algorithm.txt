      Subroutine subprograms RSMPLX and DSMPLX
      calculate the quantities  for
      which the linear form, or objective function,
    




      assumes a maximum value subject to the  inequality constraints
    




      and the  equality
      constraints
    




      A number  of the variables
       can be restricted
      to non-negative values (  ).
      The remaining  variables
       are then
      unrestricted (  ). In the
      case  , all variables
       are
      unrestricted. These subprograms can also be used for the
      so-called degenerate case.
    

      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision version DSMPLX is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single precision version
      RSMPLX is available.

Method:


      The method is described in Ref. 1 and Ref. 2.
    

Error handling:


      Error H101.1:  or
       .
      Error H101.2:  or
       or  or 
      .
      In both cases, a message is written on Unit 6,
      unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been called.
