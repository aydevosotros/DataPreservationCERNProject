      Function subprograms RGQUAD and DGQUAD
      calculate the approximate value of the integral
    




      using the N-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula
      corresponding to the interval [a,b].
    

      Subroutine subprograms RGSET and DGSET
      store, for subsequent use, the abscissae  and the weights  of the N-point Gauss-Legendre
      quadrature formula corresponding to the interval
      [a,b].
    

      The following values of N may be used: 2, 3, 4, 5,
      6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48,
      64, 80, 96.
    

RGQUAD, RGSET and DGQUAD,
      DGSET are independent subprograms: it is not
      necessary, for instance, to call DGSET in order to
      use DGQUAD, or vice-versa.
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision versions
      DGQUAD and DGSET are not provided.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE and FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: RGQUAD, RGSET, DGQUAD, DGSET
      Internal Entry Names: D107R1, D107D1
      Files Referenced: Unit 6
      External References: MTLMTR,
      ABEND, User-supplied
      FUNCTION subprogram
    

Usage:


To calculate the integral:
      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    tGQUAD(F,A,B,N)


      has, in any arithmetic expression, the value  which is an approximation to the given
      integral.
To store the abscissae  and the weights  :


    CALL tGSET(A,B,N,X,W)



        F
      

        (type according to t) Name of a user-supplied
        FUNCTION subprogram, declared EXTERNAL in
        the calling program. This subprogram must set  .
      

        A,B
      

        (type according to t) End-points a and
        b of the integration interval.
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number N of quadrature points.
      

        X,W
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional arrays. On
        exit, X(i) and W(i) contain  and
         ,
        respectively.
      


Method:


      The values of  and  are computed by linearly scaling values
      obtained from a stored table corresponding to the interval
      [-1,+1].
    

Accuracy:


      The absolute error of RGQUAD and DGQUAD is
      proportional to the value of the (2N)th derivative
      of f at some internal point of the interval
      [a,b] (see Ref. 1).
    

Error handling:


      Error D107.1: The value N does not appear
      in the list given above. A message is written on Unit
      6, unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been
      called. If the subprogram referenced is RGQUAD or
      DGQUAD, the function value is set equal to zero.
