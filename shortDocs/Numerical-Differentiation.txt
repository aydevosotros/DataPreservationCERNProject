      Subroutine subprograms RDERIV and DDERIV
      compute an approximate numerical value of the derivative
      f'(x) of a function f(x)
      at a specified point x.
    

      On computers other than CDC and Cray, only the
      double-precision version DDERIV is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RDERIV is available.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tDERIV(F,X,DELTA,DFDX,RERR)



        F
      

        (type according to t) Name of a user-supplied
        FUNCTION subprogram, declared EXTERNAL in
        the calling program. This subprogram must set  .
      

        X
      

        (type according to t) The specified point
        x for which the derivative is to be calculated.
      

        DELTA
      

        (type according to t) On entry, DELTA
        must contain a scaling factor  , which can usually be set equal to 1. On
        exit, it contains the last value of this factor (see
        Method).
      

        DFDX
      

        (type according to t) On exit, DFDX
        contains an approximation to  .
      

        RERR
      

        (type according to t) On exit, RERR
        contains an estimate of the relative error of
        DFDX.
      


Method:


      The method is based on an extension to numerical
      differentiation of Romberg's principle of sequence
      extrapolation, originally developed for numerical
      integration. The subroutine starts by computing the 10
      numbers
    




      with
    




      where the scaling factor  is
      initially set to DELTA. This procedure is repeated
      up to 9 times, with  replaced by
       each time, until
      the sequence  is found to be
      monotone. A Romberg-like triangular table
    




      with appropriate weights  is
      then computed for  and
      DFDX is set equal to  .
    

Restrictions:


      The function f(x) must be differentiable at
       and in a
      neighbourhood of X. Misleading results will be
      obtained if this is not true.
    

Error handling:


      Error D401.1: If the function f(x)
      is such that, after 9 successive reductions of  by a factor 1/10, the sequence  is not monotone, an error message is written
      Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has
      been called. DFDX is set equal to zero,
      RERR is set equal to one in this case.
