      Function subprograms RCHSUM and DCHSUM
      compute, for real arguments x in the specified
      intervals, one of the following four sums:
    




      where  is the Chebyshev
      polynomial of degree n and  .
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DCHSUM is not available.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprograms
      User Entry Names: RCHSUM, DCHSUM
      Obsolete User Entry Names: CHSUM 
RCHSUM


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


RCHSUM(MODE,C,N,X) or DCHSUM(MODE,C,N,X)



      has the value of the sum selected by MODE.
      RCHSUM is of type REAL, and DCHSUM
      is of type DOUBLE PRECISION. C and
      X have the same type as the function name.
      MODE and N are of type INTEGER.
    


        MODE
      

        Type of sum to be evaluated  .
      

        C
      

        One-dimensional array with dimension (0:d),
         , containing
        the coefficients
 .
      

        N
      

        Limit N of summation.
      

        X
      

        Argument x.
      


Notes:


      Note that some authors use a different definition for the
      constant term in (1), (2) and (4), i.e.  instead of  .
      Here, the definition of Ref. 1 is used.
