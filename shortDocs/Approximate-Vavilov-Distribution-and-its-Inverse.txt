      The VAVLOV package contains subprograms for fast
      approximate calculation of functions related to the Vavilov
      distribution.
    

      For  and  , the Vavilov density function is
      mathematically defined by
    




      where c is an arbitrary real constant and
    




 is the
      exponential integral,  ,
      and  is Euler's
      constant.
    

      The Vavilov distribution function is defined by
    




      and its inverse by  .
    

      The function  can be used to
      generate Vavilov random numbers (see Usage).

Usage:


    CALL VAVSET(RKAPPA,BETA2,MODE)


      sets auxiliary quantities used in VAVDEN,
      VAVDIS and VAVRND; this call has to precede
      a reference to any of these entries.
    


        RKAPPA
      

        The variable  (the
        straggling parameter); ( 
        ).
      

        BETA2
      

        The variable  (the
        square of velocity in unit c); (  ).
      

        MODE
      


 in the
        particular case that VAVDEN only is referenced
        after the call to VAVSET.



      In any arithmetic expression,
    








VAVDEN(X)


            has an approximate value of
          

 ,
          



VAVDIS(X)


            has an approximate value of
          

 ,
          



VAVRND(X)


            has an approximate value of
          

 ,
          




RKAPPA and BETA2 are defined by the last
      call to VAVSET prior to a reference to
      VAVDEN, VAVDIS, or VAVRND.
    

      To generate a set of Vavilov random numbers with
      identical  and  , VAVSET should be called once
      and then VAVRND be referenced repeatedly, using as
      argument X a random number from a uniform
      distribution over the interval (0,1).
    

      In any arithmetic expression,
    


VAVRAN(RKAPPA,BETA2,X) has an approximate value of
         .
      


      To generate one Vavilov random number for given
      values of  and  , VAVRAN should be used, using as
      argument X a random number from a uniform
      distribution over the interval (0,1).
    

VAVDEN, VAVDIS, VAVRND,
      VAVRAN and X, RKAPPA,
      BETA2 are of type REAL, and MODE
      is of type INTEGER.
    

Method:


      The method is discribed in Ref. 1.
    

Accuracy:


      The accuracy depends on the parameters. Although often rather
      poor from a mathematical point of view, it is usually
      sufficient for the intended application in physics (see
      Notes).
    

Restrictions:


      No test is made whether the parameters  and  are in the
      specified ranges.
    

Notes:


Representing the Vavilov functions by approximations
      which are both fast and accurate is a difficult task. In view
      of the requirements in physics, speed is much more important
      than accuracy. This is taken into account for the present
      routines.
      
For a more accurate, but much slower, calculation of the
      Vavilov density and distribution functions, use
      VVILOV (G116).
      
For  , the Vavilov
      distribution can be replaced by the Landau distribution
      (LANDAU (G110)), taking into account that
         .
      
For  , the Vavilov
      distribution can be replaced by the Gaussian distribution
      with mean
 and variance
         .
