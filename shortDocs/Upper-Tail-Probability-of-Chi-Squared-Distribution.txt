      Function subprogram PROB computes the probability
      that a random variable having a 
      -distribution with  degrees of
      freedom assumes a value which is larger than a given value
       , i.e.
    




Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Names: PROB
      External References: ERFC,
      DERFC, MTLMTR, ABEND


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression,
    


PROB(X,N) has the value  .
      


PROB and X are of type REAL and
      N is of type INTEGER.
    

Method:


      See Ref. 1, formulae Nr. 26.4.4, 26.4.5 and, for
      N>300, No. 26.4.14.
    

Accuracy:


      For  , PROB
      has an accuracy of about six digits. For  , the accuracy decreases for  with increasing X.
    

Error handling:


      Error G100.1: 
      .
      Error G100.2: 
      .
      In both cases, the function value is set equal to zero, and a
      message is written on Unit 6, unless subroutine
      MTLSET (N002) has been called.
