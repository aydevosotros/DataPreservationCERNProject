      Function subprograms GAUSS, DGAUSS and
      QGAUSS compute, to an attempted specified accuracy,
      the value of the integral
    




      The quadruple-precision version QGAUSS is available
      only on computers which support a REAL*16 Fortran
      data type.

        subprogram must set  .

        may be less than A.

GAUSS is of type REAL, DGAUSS is
      of type DOUBLE PRECISION, QGAUSS is of type
      REAL*16, and the arguments F, A,
      B, EPS and X (in F) have
      the same type as the function name.
    

Method:


      For any interval [a,b] we define
       and  to be the 8-point and 16-point Gaussian
      quadrature approximations to
    




      and define
    




      Then, with G = GAUSS or DGAUSS,
    




      where, starting with  and
      finishing with  , the
      subdivision points  are
      given by
    




      with  equal to the
      first member of the sequence  for which  .
      If, at any stage in the process of subdivision, the ratio
    




      is so small that 1+0.005q is indistinguishable from
      1 to machine accuracy, an error exit occurs with the function
      value set equal to zero.
    

Accuracy:


      Unless there is severe cancellation of positive and negative
      values of f(x) over the interval
      [A,B], the argument EPS may be
      considered as specifying a bound on the relative
      error of I in the case |I|>1, and a
      bound on the absolute error in the case
      |I|<1. More precisely, if k is the
      number of sub-intervals contributing to the approximation
      (see Method), and if
    




      then the relation
    




      will nearly always be true, provided the routine terminates
      without printing an error message. For functions f
      having no singularities in the closed interval
      [A,B] the accuracy will usually be much
      higher than this.
    

Error handling:


      Error D103.1: The requested accuracy cannot be
      obtained (see Method). The function value is
      set equal to zero, and a message is written on Unit
      6 unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been
      called.
    

Notes:


      Values of the function f(x) at the interval
      end-points A and B are not required. The
      subprogram may therefore be used when these values are
      undefined.
