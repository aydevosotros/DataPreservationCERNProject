NUMBIT counts the one-bits in a word.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Names: NUMBIT


Usage:


      In an arithmetic expression,
    


NUMBIT(X)



      has the INTEGER value giving the number of one-bits
      in X.
    

Examples:


    J=NUMBIT(5)


      sets J to 2 as the binary representation of
      5 has 2 one-bits.
