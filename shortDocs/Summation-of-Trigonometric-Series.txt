      Function subprograms RTRGSM and DTRGSM
      compute the sum of the trigonometric series
    




      for a given argument x in the range  and given coefficients  .
    

      On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version
      DTRGSM is not available.
    

Structure:


FUNCTION subprogram
      User Entry Names: RTRGSM, DTRGSM


Usage:


      In any arithmetic expression, for  (type REAL),  (type DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    tTRGSM(X,A,N,B,M,IOP)


      has the value f(x).
    


        X
      

        (Type according to t) Argument x.
      

        A
      

        (Type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        dimension (0:d) where  , containing the constant coefficient
         in
        A(0) and the cosine coefficients  in A(k).
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) The number n of cosine
        coefficients.
      

        B
      

        (Type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  , containing
        the sine coefficients 
        in B(k).
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) The number m of sine
        coefficients.
      

        IOP
      

        (INTEGER) An option number:
 the general
        case,
 all
         are zero, i.e.
        f(x)=f(-x),
 all
         are zero, i.e.
        f(x)=-f(-x).
      


Method:


      Standard recurrence relations are used for calculating the
      sum (see Ref. 1).
    

Notes:


      For a function f(z) given in the range
       , use the
      transformation
