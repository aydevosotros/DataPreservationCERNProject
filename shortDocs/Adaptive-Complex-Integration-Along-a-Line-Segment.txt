      Function subprograms CGAUSS and WGAUSS
      compute, to an attempted specified accuracy, the value of the
      complex integral
    




      The path of integration is the directed line segment
      AB in the complex z-plane. The function
      f(z) must be single-valued on this segment.
    

      The double-precision version WGAUSS is available
      only on computers which support a COMPLEX*16 Fortran
      data type.

CGAUSS is of type COMPLEX, WGAUSS
      is of type COMPLEX*16, and the arguments F,
      A, B, and Z (in F) have
      the same type as the function name. EPS is of type
      REAL for CGAUSS and of type DOUBLE
      PRECISION for WGAUSS.
    

Method:


      For any line segment [a,b] we define
       and  to be the 8-point and 16-point Gaussian
      quadrature approximations to
    




      and define
    




      Then, with G = CGAUSS or WGAUSS,
    




      where, starting with  and
      finishing with  , the
      subdivision points  are
      given by
    




      with  equal to the
      first member of the sequence  for which  .
      If, at any stage in the process of subdivision, the ratio
    




      is so small that 1+0.005q is indistinguishable from
      1 to machine accuracy, an error exit occurs with the function
      value set equal to zero.
    

Accuracy:


      Unless there is severe cancellation of positive and negative
      values of f(z) over the interval
      [A,B], the argument EPS may be
      considered as specifying a bound on the relative
      error of I in the case |I| > 1, and a
      bound on the absolute error in the case
      |I|<1. More precisely, if k is the
      number of sub-intervals contributing to the approximation
      (see Method), and if
    




      then the relation
    




      will nearly always be true, provided the routine terminates
      without printing an error message. For functions f
      having no singularities in the closed interval
      [A,B] the accuracy will usually be much
      higher than this.
    

Error handling:


      Error D113.1: The requested accuracy (see
      Method) cannot be obtained. The function
      value is set equal to zero, and a message is written on
      Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has
      been called.
    

Notes:


      Values of the function f(z) at the
      end-points of the line segment A and B are
      not required. The subprogram may therefore be used when these
      values are undefined.
