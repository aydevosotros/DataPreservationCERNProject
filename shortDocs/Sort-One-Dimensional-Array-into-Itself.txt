      The FLPSOR package contains two entry points for
      sorting a one-dimensional array, containing either floating
      point number or integers, into itself. The sort is done in
      ascending order.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: FLPSOR, INTSOR


Usage:


    CALL FLPSOR(A,N)


      sorts the first N elements of the REAL
      array A in ascending order into itself.
    

    CALL INTSOR(IA,N)


      sorts the first N elements of the INTEGER
      array IA in ascending order into itself.

      SORTZV (M101).
    

      Based on an Algol procedure described in Ref. 1.
