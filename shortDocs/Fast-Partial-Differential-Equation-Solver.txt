ELPAHY uses fast Fourier transform techniques for
      the solution, over a rectangular domain, of the following
      elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic part differential equation:
    




      where  is the unknown
      function,  the known source
      term, and  given
      coefficients. A large variety of boundary conditions can be
      specified on the sides of the rectangle.

Usage:


    CALL ELPAHY(F,NX,NY,DX,DY,C,IBX,BWEST,BEAST,JBY,BSOUTH,BNORTH)



        F
      

        (REAL) Two-dimensional array, dimensioned
        (NX,NY) in the calling program. On input it
        contains the source term 
        and on return it contains the unknown function  .
      

        NX
      

        (INTEGER) Number of divisions along X.
        NX must be of the form  .
      

        NY
      

        (INTEGER) Number of divisions along Y.
      

        DX
      

        (REAL) Mesh spacing along X.
      

        DY
      

        (REAL) Mesh spacing along Y.
      

        C
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of dimension
        3, containing the coefficients  .
      

        IBX
      

        (INTEGER) Controls the type of boundary conditions
        on the left (BWEST) and right (BEAST)
        sides of the rectangular domain:
 Imposed
        periodicity along x; BWEST,
        BEAST not given.
 Given
        derivative on either vertical side.
 Given value on
        either vertical side.
 Given value on
        the left side, given derivative on the right side.
      

        BWEST
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of size NY
        containing values or derivatives for the left side; the
        interpretation depends on IBX.
      

        BEAST
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of size NY
        containing values or derivatives for the right side; the
        interpretation depends on IBX.
      

        JBY
      

        (INTEGER) Controls the type of boundary conditions
        on the lower (BSOUTH) und upper (BNORTH)
        sides of the rectangular domain:
Elliptic equation (  ):
 Given value on
        both lower and upper sides.
 Given
        derivative on both lower and upper sides.
 Given value on
        lower side, given derivative on upper side.
 Given
        derivative on lower side, given value on upper side.
Parabolic equation (  ):
        Specify BSOUTH array only. (If y=time,
        BSOUTH are initial values and the future
        BNORTH cannot be specified).
 Given value on
        lower side.
 Given
        derivative on lower side.
Hyperbolic equation (  ):
        The BSOUTH array specifies the value, the
        BNORTH array the derivative.
 .
      

        BSOUTH
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of size NX
        containing values or derivatives for the lower side; the
        interpretation depends on JBY.
      

        BNORTH
      

        (REAL) One-dimensional array of size NX
        containing values or derivatives for the upper side; the
        interpretation depends on JBY.
      


Notes:


      If  , specify
      COMMON /FWORK/ of length 6*NX and
      COMMON /FW1/ of length 6*NX in the calling
      program. If  , specify
      COMMON /FW2/ of length 2*NY. In either
      case, make sure your program is loaded before ELPAHY
      (D302) (this is automatic unless you recompile D302 in the
      same job).
